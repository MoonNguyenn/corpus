Bien Hoa.\\n\\n\\nHead of the Central Propaganda Department Vo Van Thuong at the meeting with Dong Nai province on June 20, 2018.\\nAt the meeting, the delegates listened to many opinions and recommendations of voters related to people's livelihood issues, land disputes, social insurance, settlement of regimes and policies for people with meritorious services. The content of the Law on Cybersecurity and the draft Law on Special Administrative-Economic Units continued to be of interest to voters, asking questions to the National Assembly deputies.\\n\\nTalking to voters, Head of the Central Propaganda Department Vo Van Thuong said that the Law on Cybersecurity had just been passed by the National Assembly with a high number of votes. According to Mr. Vo Van Thuong, information technology is developing strongly to create a virtual environment, although it is virtual, it is real.\\n\\nCybersecurity is a very important issue, the introduction of the Cybersecurity Law is to regulate relationships in cyberspace in order to protect national security, social order and safety, rights and interests. of organizations and individuals, handling those who commit acts of violating the law.\\n\\n“It must be affirmed that there is absolutely no violation of the right to freedom of speech, the right to express opinions and political opinions of citizens. On the contrary, it also creates conditions for the exercise of this right in accordance with the provisions of law. Everyone has the right to express opinions, but we have to follow the law, not that we speak freely and do whatever we want.

      " 'The Law contains Chapter 1 - General provisions, Article 8 - Prohibited acts on network security, Section d - False information causing confusion among people, causing damage to economic and social activities society, causing difficulties for the operation of state agencies or official duty performers, infringing upon the lawful rights and interests of other agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\nWhy is the release and spread of false information noticed by Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law as well as similar laws of many countries around the world? That is due to the nature and degree of danger that fake news can cause to national security, the economy as well as safety and social order.\\n\\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US spent 11 years studying 126,000 rumors and fake news on Twitter and found that fake news spread faster than real news, was posted more. The reason is that fake news is \"hotter\" and the popular topic is politics, followed by news related to economics, terrorism, science, natural disasters... The results of the MIT study published in the journal Science (Science) says that fake news is retweeted 70% more than real news; real news took 6 times longer than fake news to reach 1,500 internet users; True news rarely has more than 1,000 shares, while many fake news have up to 100,000 shares.\\n\\nInternet users are dominated by the sensational nature of fake news, regardless of how much of it is true or not at all. Because we live in an era of information saturation, the more unique, strange, creepy, and violent news is, the more it attracts online users.\\n\\nSocial networks develop like a storm with the connection of hundreds of millions of people on the planet with positive and negative sides. The negative side is evident when fake news is not controlled and the “creator” who spreads fake news is not responsible for his or her actions. Cyberspace is increasingly being used by criminal, terrorist, anti-subversive and extremist groups to cause social disturbances, smear individuals, organizations, and even an entire country. The Chicago Board of Crime Prevention and Control (USA) said that more than 50 criminal groups here use social networks - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ... to trade drugs and carry out illegal activities. other.\\n\\nInformation from Google technology company shows that in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, the Internet is developing at the fastest pace on Earth with an online community of more than 400 million people. This also entails \"hidden corners\" from social networks.\\n\\nThe Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education has called on the authorities to strictly monitor social networking sites to prevent the spread of extremist ideology among young people, especially students. This comes after police in June 2018 discovered a group of alumni using social media to plan a bomb attack on Aras Mulyadi University.\\n\\nThe Thai government has planned to spend millions of dollars to deploy a system to store and analyze social network data to avoid the spread of malicious fake news on the Internet. In Malaysia, the anti-fake news law imposes a prison sentence of six years for those who spread fake news online.\\n\\nAccording to Vietnam\\'s Ministry of Information and Communications, this agency has granted operating licenses to 436 social networks with many users, including Facebook, Youtube, FB Messenger, Zalo, Google+... As for We\\'s 2018 report. are Social said that Facebook has over 55 million members in Vietnam, accounting for 57% of the population.\\n\\nVietnam is also ranked 7th out of 10 countries with the largest number of Facebook users in the world with the age group 25-34 making up the majority. The Internet and Social Research Program (VPIS) of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities shows that hate speech by social network users in Vietnam is expressed in defamation and defamation. accounted for 61.7%), slander, fabricated (46.6%), ethnic discrimination (37.01%), sexism (29.03%), disability discrimination (21.76%) ), religious discrimination (15.09%).\\n\\nA large part of netizens in Vietnam believes that in a virtual environment like a social network, no one is responsible for their statements. Moreover, the handling from the domestic authorities faces legal barriers because most of the social networks have servers located abroad.\\n\\nIn many cases, social media dominates the mainstream media in guiding public opinion in sensitive cases. We have learned a valuable lesson when fake news, distorted news, and misrepresentation of the truth spread on social networks, inciting disgruntled, extremist, ignorant people to rebel and fight like in self-interests. using environmental issues in Formusa Ha Tinh, protesting the Draft Law on Administrative Units-Special Economic Zones, the Law on Cybersecurity...\\n\\nMedia expert Le Quoc Minh (Deputy General Director of Vietnam News Agency) in his presentations to journalists in Vietnam has repeatedly affirmed not to underestimate fake news and must have a sense of prevention early. Fake news has been quietly appearing in Vietnam for a long time, but few people pay attention. Even if fake news becomes \"unsupport global crisis\" after the US presidential election, many people in the country still do not see this as a serious problem.\\n\\nBut it can be affirmed that fake news is really a threat to society. In the world, fake news is rampant and Vietnam is no exception to this trend. We have seen a lot of innocuous, even misleading, content that has been widely distributed by social media users. Among those who share such false information on social networks, there are also reputable, influential figures, even said to be \"more knowledgeable\" than many other users, such as journalists. newspaper.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeputy General Director of Vietnam News Agency Le Quoc Minh.\\n\\nAccording to expert Le Quoc Minh, Internet users must be careful, consider and verify information before \"entering the mind\" or sharing with others information that is spread online, especially about sensitive issues. affecting national security, national economy and social order.\\n\\nBefore the Law on Cybersecurity took effect, the sanctions in the 2017 Penal Code were not enough of a deterrent against slanderous and insulting acts that smeared the image of the country and the reputation of organizations and individuals. There has been a breach of the law.\\n\\nAccording to the general perception in the online community in Vietnam, the fact that “false information causes confusion among people…,” in other words, “fake news,” is not a serious violation of the law. , even just the act of \"joking, amusing,\" at most only being \"reminded.\"\\n\\nHowever, the Law on Cybersecurity stipulates very clearly in Article 9 - Handling of violations of the law on cyber security: \"Whoever commits acts of violating the provisions of this Law shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, if they are disciplined, administratively handled or examined for penal liability, if causing damage, they must pay compensation in accordance with law.\"\\n\\nThus, the birth of the Cybersecurity Law is a timely and necessary decision to protect national security, social order and also protect network users themselves, and at the same time build a healthy network environment. safe.\\n\\nIt is time for network users to be highly conscious of their behavior on social networks if they do not want to bear civil and even criminal liability.'\n",

Therefore, the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is very necessary, appropriate, and meets the urgent requirements of the current practical situation.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity consists of 7 chapters and 43 articles that stipulate the basic contents of cybersecurity protection for information systems important for national security; prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security; deploying network security protection activities and stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\nOne of the important contents of the Law lies in Chapter II, which provides for the protection of network security for information systems important to national security. The content of this chapter presents a full range of protection measures and activities commensurate with the importance of this information system. In which, defining criteria, related fields, and measures such as network security appraisal, condition assessment, inspection and monitoring of network security and response and remediation of security incidents are outlined. network security for information systems important to national security.\\n\\nLet people feel secure to operate in cyberspace\\n\\nLieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan, Director of the Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity Department (Ministry of Public Security), affirmed that, in order to maximize the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals in cyberspace, the Law stipulates a full range of measures. measures to prevent, fight and handle in order to eliminate threats, detect and handle violations of law, including prevention and handling of online information with propaganda content against the Republic of Vietnam. socialist Vietnam; inciting riots, disrupting security and disrupting public order; humiliate, slander; infringing upon the economic management order; prevention and combat of cyber espionage, protection of state secret information, work secrets, and personal information online;...\\n\\n\"This is a solid legal corridor so that people can feel secure to trade, do business or operate in cyberspace,\" emphasized Lieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan.\\n\\nCurrently, user data in Vietnam online has been widely used, for profit purposes, but the state does not have enough legal corridor to manage. Even the data has been used for political conspiracies or in violation of the law. Therefore, in order to strictly manage and protect Vietnam\\'s data online, the Law stipulates that domestic and foreign enterprises providing services in cyberspace must operatecollecting, exploiting, analyzing and processing personal data, service user relationship data, data generated by service users in Vietnam must store this data in Vietnam .\\n\\nForeign enterprises specified in this Clause must set up branches or representative offices in Vietnam.

This is a necessary activity, belonging to the responsibility, not related to business activities.\\n\\nPoint b, Clause 2, Article 21 stipulates that telecommunications, Internet, information technology enterprises, service providers on telecommunications networks, the internet, and added services in cyberspace are responsible for coordinating with The Ministry of Public Security in preventing, detecting and handling dangerous situations in cyber security.\\n\\nA dangerous cyber security situation is an event that occurs in cyberspace when there is a serious act of infringing upon national security, causing particularly serious harm to social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests. laws of agencies, organizations and individuals. Therefore, when a dangerous cyber security situation occurs, businesses are responsible for coordinating handling.\\n\\nArticle 26 stipulates that domestic and foreign enterprises, when providing services on telecommunications networks, the internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam, have the responsibility to coordinate with specialized forces to protect network security. in network information security.\\n\\nClause 2, Article 29, stipulates the responsibilities of domestic and foreign enterprises when providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace in handling information that is harmful to children. in cyberspace.\\n\\nArticle 41 stipulates the responsibilities of enterprises providing services in cyberspace in preventing and handling cyberattacks; warn of the possibility of network insecurity and coordinate and create conditions for the specialized network to protect network security in network security protection activities.\\n\\nThus, of the seven regulations related to the responsibilities of service providers in cyberspace, none of them are related to their business activities, start-up activities, import and export. exporting and manufacturing equipment of enterprises. Except for coordinating with the network security protection force to handle illegal acts in cyberspace and a number of responsibilities specified in Article 41 related to warning, remedy, handling violations of the law, enterprises do not have to fulfill any other obligations for their business activities.\\n\\nFacing some distorting propaganda opinions, leading the public to believe that the Law on Cybersecurity will hinder business activities of enterprises, Lieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan (Director of the Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity Department, Ministry of Public Security) ) affirms that this law contains no provisions governing the establishment of a business, start-up, investment, purchase, sale, or business of an enterprise; The law also does not require businesses providing services in cyberspace to have a sublicense to operate.\\n\\nCreate a healthy business environment\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity is widely considered to be the legal basis for creating a very level playing field. Not only that, many representatives of telecommunications and network service businesses also said that businesses and customers in Vietnam will benefit when the Law on Cybersecurity is promulgated.\\n\\nDiscussing this issue, Mr. Nguyen Hoa Binh, President of NextTech Group, said that since the Internet was present in Vietnam, there have been many cases of interference and cyberattacks on State agencies and businesses. by domestic and foreign \"hackers\". With such acts, the current law lacks legal corridors. The introduction of the Cybersecurity Law helps to handle intrusions and attacksIn addition, Mr. Binh believes that Vietnamese enterprises will benefit from this legal corridor.\\n\\n\"There is currently no law regulating domestic and foreign enterprises for many years, creating injustice. For example, foreign enterprises doing business in Vietnam generate a lot of revenue, but are not headquartered in Vietnam. , do not create jobs for domestic workers, do not bring in tax revenue and are less subject to the management of the authorities, meanwhile, domestic enterprises directly create jobs and jobs for people. labor, is under the strict management of the authorities,\" analyzed the President of NextTech Group. Therefore, first of all, the Law will contribute to creating a healthy competitive environment between domestic and foreign enterprises in cyberspace. \"Accordingly, how domestic enterprises are managed, foreign enterprises must also be managed in the same way,\" Mr. Binh said.\\n\\nIn addition, for domestic internet service businesses, when internet data is stored in Vietnam, the cost of transmission lines will be reduced. For domestic businesses operating in commerce and advertising on the internet through Facebook, Google, Youtube..., foreign businesses will have to share tax obligations.\\n\\nAccording to Mr. Le Dang Phong, Network Exploitation Department of VNPT-Net Network Infrastructure Corporation, with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, domestic customers will benefit when domestic and foreign businesses will develop, upgrade technical infrastructure; diversifying types as well as improving the quality of services in cyberspace.'\n",

According to the Ministry of Information and Communications, in 2017, information systems in Vietnam suffered about 15,000 cyber attacks, including about 3,000 phishing attacks, 6,500 software attacks. malicious (Malware) and 4,500 interface change attacks (Deface). In particular, the number of attacks on the information systems of state agencies with the domain name \".gov.vn\" also reached hundreds.\\n\\nIn 2017, the damage caused by computer viruses to Vietnamese users reached 12,300 billion VND (540 million USD), far exceeding the 10,400 billion VND mark of 2016 and has reached a record in recent years.\\n\\nIn the first 5 months of 2018, 4,035 incidents of cyberattacks were recorded in Vietnam, in February and March alone, there were more than 1,500 cyberattacks; Besides, with about 637,400 controlled computers in infected computer networks (ghost computer networks - botnets), Vietnam ranks fourth in the Top 10 countries controlled by ghost computer networks. .\\n\\nInsecurity vulnerabilities are increasing, about more than 300% per year, causing the risk of network information security to increase rapidly when entering the Industrial Revolution 4.0.\\n\\nIn the face of such permanent cyber attacks against Vietnam, the specialized cyber security forces of the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National Defense and other Vietnamese authorities have focused all technical solutions on as well as people to prevent and combat cyber attacks, but it is difficult to achieve the highest efficiency.\\n\\nAccording to cybersecurity experts, current protection is not enough to deal with modern cyber attacks because different implementations are often independent of each other; The lack of a clear legal framework creates a responsibility to link the implementation measures of the Vietnamese authorities with each other, especially with other countries.\\n\\nMost countries have effective cyber-attack prevention systems, in addition to technical solutions, people also have a specific legal corridor.\\n\\n\"That said, it is only possible to effectively prevent cyberattacks, in addition to technical measures, people must have a specific and clear legal system that is eligible to deploy legal and legal measures. international cooperation\" - Major General Nguyen Minh Duc emphasized.\\n\\nIn fact, in the face of increasingly modern and sophisticated targeted cyber attacks, only one mistake of agencies, organizations, businesses and users can bear very heavy consequences, so most of them proactively propose a specialized force to protect network security to help check from the beginning, as well as regularly, their equipment and network system, so that they can feel secure in production and business.\\n\\nA part is afraid of being inspected and supervised because they do not understand the importance and effective help from the agency in charge of protecting network security, or there may be many shady business cases. Due to lack of transparency, fear of being checked.\\n\\nThe provisions in Chapter 2 of the Draft Law on Cybersecurity stipulate that the agency in charge of cyber security protection of the Ministry of Public Security must be responsible for protecting national security and social order and safety in cyberspace.\\n\\nBefore the draft Law on Cybersecurity stipulating information systems important for national security, there was no legal document on this content, even when the Law on Cyberinformation Security was promulgated.\\n\\nTherefore, information systems important to national security are not protected commensurate with their importance.\\n\\n[Cybersecurity Law: Prohibited information and handling methods]\\n\\nNot obstructing the activities of people and businesses\\n\\nMajor General Nguyen Minh Duc said that the regulation \"Stored in Vietnam for personal information of users in Vietnam and important data related to national security; setting up a head office or representative office in Vietnam” at point d, clause 2, Article 26 is feasible, in accordance with domestic laws, international practices, not contrary to the treaties to which we have acceded, nor hinder business operations.\\n\\nMajor General Nguyen Minh Duc gave 5 factors to prove the above argument.\\n\\nFirstly, about storing important national data in the country, according to statistics, there are currently 18 countries in the world that require data storage in the country, such as the US, Canada, the Russian Federation, France, etc. Germany, China, Australia, Indonesia, Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Turkey, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil.\\n\\nAs such is the international practice, we are not the first country to apply this regulation.Secondly, through reviewing documents of commitments to join WTO such as General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994), General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), Agreement on Aspects related to trade of intellectual property rights (TRIPS); At the same time, reviewing the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), I found that these documents all contain provisions on security exceptions, allowing respect and protection of national security in Vietnam. highest level.\\n\\nThe most objective example is that the 18 countries mentioned above have all joined the WTO, which means they do not violate the WTO commitments they have just made. Thus, it can be affirmed that we do not violate international commitments.\\n\\nThird, about representative offices, according to the provisions of our country\\'s law on commerce, foreign trade promotion organizations must set up representative offices in Vietnam according to the 2005 Commercial Law, the Law on Foreign Trade Management, and the Law on Foreign Trade. 2017 and the guiding documents, directly is the Government\\'s Decree 28/2018/ND-CP detailing the Law on Foreign Trade Management on a number of measures to develop foreign trade.\\n\\nCurrently, Google has set up about 70 representative offices, Facebook about 80 representative offices in countries around the world.\\n\\nParticularly in Southeast Asia, Google, Facebook have opened representative offices in Singapore (Google and Facebook both have data storage servers in this country), Malaysia, Indonesia (Facebook alone has set up data centers according to the law). Indonesian law 2014).\\n\\n\"This is in accordance with domestic law. If the above businesses are hindered and affect their business interests, they will certainly not set up nearly 100 representative offices in countries around the world as mentioned before. On the other hand, the regulation of setting up representative offices will create an equal business environment because domestic enterprises are subject to many legal regulations right from the time of registration as well as during operation. while foreign enterprises do not bear any obligations\" - Major General Duc explained.\\n\\nFourth, the above regulation is focused and focused. Regarding data, this regulation does not require the storage of all data related to Vietnam in cyberspace, does not require the storage of platform data, but only requires storage for some data. specific types of data, related to personal secrets in case of necessity, and data related to national security, because this is the property of citizens, the property of the country needs to be managed and protected. guard.\\n\\nRegarding the subjects of application, the regulations do not apply to all agencies and organizations operating in Vietnam\\'s cyberspace, only to a number of service-providing agencies and organizations that are used by them. , taking advantage of or affecting national security.\\n\\nIn terms of management, data management is done through data centers in Vietnam and by management tools. When foreign agencies and organizations provide services in cyberspace and own an information system in Vietnam that stores data, Vietnamese authorities will coordinate with agencies and organizations providing services in cyberspace. services in cyberspace develop tools for managing and monitoring the use of these types of data. The Government will specify this content.\\n\\nFifth, in practice, the failure to manage user data and important national data has been affecting national interests and security.\\n\\nRegarding national security and crime prevention, at present, hostile, reactionary, oppositional forces and criminals are increasingly using cyberspace to infringe on national security, social order and safety. while the authorities face many difficulties in investigating, verifying, tracing and handling these violations because all data is located abroad; Foreign enterprises often lack goodwill, do not cooperate, do not provide or provide relevant information slowly, leading to unsecured legal handling.\\n\\nIn terms of national interests, user data is an asset of infinite exploitation value, an input material for many economic activities with high profit value, while foreign agencies and organizations If we earn trillions of dong a year from Vietnamese user data, our country is losing tax revenue. Regulations on data storage and representative offices will contribute to removing the above difficulties.\\n\\nRegarding the privacy of personal information, the draft stipulates that authorities must provide user information to the specialized cyber security force under the Ministry of Public Security upon written request. Many people fear that their personal information will be leaked.\\n\\n\"However, I can confirm that there will never be any leakage of user information. In fact, since its inception, the specialized forces of the Ministry of Public Security have always performed the task of house management. in terms of security and order, including from residence management, citizen identification; traffic; business lines subject to security and order conditions; entry and exit; ... never there is a leak of information.\\n\\nThe guarantee of absolute confidentiality of personal informationof citizens is not only a responsibility but also a legal obligation; if it is let loose, it will be strictly handled according to the provisions of law, depending on the nature, extent and consequences\" - Major General Nguyen Minh Duc emphasized.'\n",

      " 'On this occasion, the VNA reporter interviewed Lieutenant General, Associate Professor-Dr. Hoang Phuoc Thuan, Director of the Cybersecurity Department, Ministry of Public Security, Standing Committee of the Drafting Committee, Head of the Editorial Team to develop the Security Law. network to clarify information related to this draft Law.\\n\\nNot required to store all data\\n\\n- Lieutenant General, currently, the situation of cyber security is complicated, a series of cases related to cyber attacks and cyber security have caused serious consequences which have been mentioned by the press recently. Can you tell us the necessity of building and promulgating the Law on Cybersecurity in the context of our country?\\n\\nLieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan: Recently, the situation of cyber security in the world and in Vietnam has been complicated. Every year, our country\\'s information system suffers from tens of thousands of attacks. Fabricated information, mixed truth and falsehood, slander, libel, insult, incitement to violence ... are common in cyberspace, especially social networks.\\n\\nCyberspace becomes a \"safe haven\" for criminals and law-breakers; Cybercrime, especially organized crime, has complicated developments, especially gambling activities, gambling organizations, frauds to appropriate property, trade in counterfeit and banned goods... One of the main reasons This is due to the lack of a legal framework.\\n\\n[Handling acts of violating national security in cyberspace]\\n\\nThe formulation and promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity derives from the urgent requirements of the domestic cybersecurity situation, the protection of national security, state secrets, social order and safety, the rights and interests of the nation. legitimate interests of organizations and individuals; overcome the shortcomings, inadequacies and limitations of the state management of network security and information security; further enhance the management role of functional ministries and branches in ensuring network security and information security; at the same time, fully and promptly institutionalize the Party\\'s guidelines and guidelines on cyber security, ensuring conformity with the provisions of the 2013 Constitution on human rights, fundamental rights of citizens and protection of the Internet. Defending the Fatherland, ensuring conformity with international practices, when many countries around the world have promulgated the Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\n- Lieutenant General, at present, cyberspace is present in all areas of social life, including commercial activities. It is known that in the draft there are specific regulations on the requirements for storing user data and important data in the country. So please tell me, who will be subject to this regulation and what data will be stored in the country?\\n\\nLieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan: We all know that the requirement to store important data in the country has been regulated by many countries, such as the US, Canada, the Russian Federation, Germany, China, Indonesia, etc. Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Turkey, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil...\\n\\nAccording to public information, on May 25, the European Union\\'s Personal Data Protection Regulation officially came into effect, allowing citizens to control their personal data when participating in forums. forums, social networks in the direction of being able to look up, change and delete their personal information; Service providers must disclose to customers how personal information is used, commit not to transfer personal data to third parties, if violations can be fined up to 20 million euros or 40 million euros. % of the offending company\\'s global sales. This shows that regulations like the current draft Law on Cybersecurity are appropriate and progressive.\\n\\nPlease confirm that the draft Law on Cybersecurity does not stipulate that all agencies and organizations must comply with this provision and it is not mandatory to store all data. The Government will detail the types of agencies, organizations and types of data that must be complied with, on the basis of requirements on security protection, public order, culture, ethics, fine customs and traditions of Vietnam. Male.\\n\\nCompulsory storage of certain types of data in the territory of Vietnam\\n\\n- Recently, there are many opinions that the above data storage regulations are not consistent with the provisions of international commitments to which Vietnam has joined, hindering the international data circulation or affect domestic GDP. What is your opinion on this matter?\\n\\nLieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan: When developing this regulation, the Drafting Committee carefully reviewed the international commitments and treaties to which Vietnam is a member, including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the WTO. Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Therefore, I affirm that the regulations on data storage in the draft Cybersecurity Law are not contrary to, do not violate commitments and do not hinder Vietnam\\'s implementation of international commitments.\\n\\nWe all know that bilateral or multilateral commitments have exceptions for security, public order, culture and public health. This means that the interests of the countries participating in the commitments are always upheld and respected, without any commitments forcing us to sacrifice these interests. We also have precedents from a number of participating countriesWTO has similar regulations, they are regulated ie not violating the scope of WTO commitments.\\n\\nRegarding the idea that this regulation impedes the international circulation of data, I can confirm that there are no obstacles at all. Cloud computing technology allows data access from anywhere, no matter where it is stored, Vietnam or the US. The draft Law on Cybersecurity only stipulates the mandatory storage of certain types of data in the territory of Vietnam, but does not prevent access to the data.\\n\\nRecently, some individuals cited data from the European Center for Political Economy Research (ECIPE) saying that the \"localization of data\" will cause Vietnam\\'s GDP to decrease by 1.7% and foreign investment. other than a decrease of 3.1%.\\n\\nHowever, they \"forgot\" to mention that this metric was extracted from ECIPE\\'s March 2014 report titled \"The costs of data localization: Friendly fire on economic recovery\". data localization: Action that undermines economic recovery”) and is based on the most negative scenarios. This report also mentions and makes similar forecasts for the European Union, China, India, Korea, Indonesia, Brazil.\\n\\nWe all know reality has proven otherwise. For example, in 2015, one year after ECIPE made the above statement, Vietnam\\'s GDP grew at the highest rate in 5 years and now we are still maintaining very impressive growth. Currently, the European Union and the above country are increasingly tightening the management of personal data. Therefore, the above forecast is incorrect and it is intentional to include the above data with incomplete citation.\\n\\n- Thus, when having a thorough and scientific approach to the provisions in the draft, it will be found that the regulations requiring data storage are consistent with domestic laws, international practices, not contrary to treaties to which we join, nor hinder the operation of the business. However, there are also opinions that this regulation will not be feasible when currently, businesses use cloud computing and virtualized servers to store data. What is your opinion on this matter?\\n\\nLieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan: As I just mentioned, cloud computing technology allows data to be transferred no matter where it is stored. Therefore, data storage regulations such as the draft Law on Cybersecurity are completely feasible in terms of technology and do not cause any obstacles. Similar regulations have also been applied in many countries.\\n\\nIn fact, according to the data we know, Google and Facebook have set up nearly 2,000 servers in our country to increase service quality. This shows that data storage as stated is not only feasible in terms of technology, but also helps to increase connection quality and service quality.\\n\\nNot intended to cause difficulties for businesses\\n\\n- Lieutenant General, currently there is an opinion that all businesses doing business in cyberspace related to Vietnam must set up representative offices in Vietnam, causing difficulties for businesses in terms of information. costs and procedures. Could you please give your opinion on this matter?\\n\\nLieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan: We understand that this is a statement that comes from legitimate concerns of businesses. We are well aware of the importance of foreign businesses when participating in the Vietnamese market. The draft Law on Cybersecurity itself is promulgated with the goal of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals, including foreign businesses. Therefore, the provisions in the draft Law on Cybersecurity are not intended to cause difficulties for businesses and are not intended to compel all businesses.\\n\\nHowever, according to our country\\'s laws, including the 2005 Commercial Law, the 2017 Law on Foreign Trade Management and guiding documents, stipulates that foreign trade promotion organizations must set up representative offices. represented in Vietnam. We all see the fact that businesses providing cross-border services such as Google and Facebook are having lucrative business activities in Vietnam.\\n\\nAs far as I know, Google has set up about 70 representative offices, Facebook about 80 representative offices in countries around the world. In Southeast Asia, Google and Facebook have opened representative offices in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Why would Google and Facebook do this if it weren\\'t for the fact that setting up a representative office is convenient for businesses.\\n\\nOne fact we need to recognize is that our organizations and businesses are subject to a lot of adjustments from the law when operating in electronic media, websites, social networks, etc. time, take responsibility for our security, public order, culture, social ethics, fine customs and traditions. However, businesses providing services across the border into Vietnam are not subject to any constraints. Therefore, the registration of foreign enterprises as legal entities in Vietnam will help us create a fair and responsible business environment.\\n\\nHowever, due to the international commitments we are involved in, the draft Cybersecurity Law does not mandate that all businessesTo set up a representative office that will base on the requirements of national security protection, social order and safety and the Government will have detailed regulations.\\n\\nOn this occasion, we would also like to thank the generous comments of the people, business community and international friends who have helped us to complete the draft Law on Cybersecurity through nearly 30 revisions. We look forward to continuing to receive comments and hope that people, organizations, and businesses at home and abroad will make efforts and join hands with Vietnamese authorities to protect the security of the country. network security, contributing to building a safe and healthy cyberspace, making an important contribution to the socio-economic development of each country and the whole world.'\n",

The bill was first commented on at the 4th session at the end of 2017.\\n\\nThe majority of delegates agreed on the necessity of promulgating the Law on Cybersecurity in the current context, in order to ensure national security and social order and safety in cyberspace. However, many delegates had mixed opinions on whether foreign network enterprises should set up a representative office in Vietnam.\\n\\nRegarding ensuring information security in cyberspace for foreign enterprises when providing telecommunications and Internet services in Vietnam (Clause 4, Article 34 of the draft Law submitted by the Government), many opinions agree with the regulation. The law requires foreign enterprises, when providing telecommunications and Internet services in Vietnam, to set up a representative agency or server to manage Vietnamese user data in Vietnam.\\n\\nSome opinions disagree with this regulation because they think that it is difficult to ensure the feasibility, is not true to reality, increases the costs of foreign enterprises, makes it difficult for activities to access information and is contrary to reality. With international commitments to which Vietnam is a member... it is recommended to study other management methods accordingly.\\n\\nIn this regard, Chairman of the National Assembly's Committee for National Defense and Security Vo Trong Viet presented a report on explaining, absorbing and revising the Cybersecurity Law project, saying that after considering many aspects, and at the same time participating in Referring to similar provisions of the laws of some countries that are members of the WTO, on the requirement to set up a data management server in the territory of Vietnam, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly has directed not to stipulate this content in this article. draft Law to ensure the feasibility and convenience for the operation of foreign enterprises when providing services to Vietnam.\\n\\n[Handling acts of violating national security in cyberspace]\\n\\nRegarding the requirement to set up a representative agency and store Vietnamese user data in the Vietnamese territory, the National Assembly Standing Committee proposed to retain this content in the draft Law and combine it with similar provisions for domestic enterprises to amend into Clause 2, Article 26 of the revised draft Law.\\n\\nSuch regulation will meet the requirements of protecting national sovereignty over electronic data and handling situations and acts in cyberspace that infringe upon national security, social order and safety. Besides, it is consistent with the international treaties to which Vietnam is a member, in accordance with the 2013 Constitution and meets the requirements of the current practical situation. Such regulation also creates a legal corridor for functional ministries and branches to strictly manage the activities of enterprises providing cross-border services into Vietnam; ensure payment sovereignty, combat loss of tax collection; ensure the fairness between foreign enterprises and domestic enterprises.\\n\\nGiving opinions at the discussion groups, the delegates agreed that the amendments and supplements to the Law on Amnesty in 2007 are necessary to ensure compliance with the 2013 Constitution, with the provisions of the laws related to private equity. New criminal law was approved by the National Assembly and solved problems and difficulties in the work of amnesty consideration over the past time.\\n\\nRegarding the Coast Guard Law project, delegates agreed that the promulgation of the law is necessary, in order to institutionalize the Party's guidelines and policies, and relevant provisions of the 2013 Constitution on strengthening the potential of the Coast Guard. national defense and security, and building forces at sea, overcoming obstacles and inadequacies in the implementation of the Ordinance on the Vietnam Coast Guard.\\n\\nAccording to delegates, the bill was raised from the Ordinance on the Coast Guard, but with significant additions in content, besides, the delegates asked the drafting committee to continue to review the current regulations. , including sub-law documents to provide more comprehensive, comprehensive and complete regulations.\"\n",

These are activities that take advantage of cyberspace to infringe upon national security and social order and safety, such as propaganda, misrepresentation, slander against the State, cyber espionage activities to steal state secrets. , infringing upon economic interests, social order and safety, in which, emerging activities of fraud, theft, gambling, betting and online prostitution; stealing personal information, slandering, humiliating others online and higher is cyber attack, hijacking, cyber terrorism, cyber war...\\n\\nThe above problems are extremely pressing and painful situations that have been happening, but the handling is very passive, embarrassing, and ineffective because the legal system of our country does not have a legal corridor. fully manage specific and clear regulations on illegal acts in cyberspace.\\n\\nIn addition, the promulgation of the Law also contributes to the fight to prevent and effectively handle violations of the law, national security and social order and safety, as well as violations of the law. violate the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals in cyberspace.\\n\\nDelegate Cao Dinh Thuong (Phu Tho) agrees with the addition of policies on network securitysuch as: policy to protect national cyber infrastructure; protect information systems important for national security; building a specialized force for network security protection; prioritizing investment and allocating funding.\\n\\nThe building of a specialized force to protect network security is very necessary and especially important to prevent and protect cyberspace against the risks of targeted attacks.\\n\\nDelegates suggested that it be necessary to specify conditions and criteria for recruitment of people into the specialized force for cybersecurity protection; specific tasks of the cybersecurity force in order to strictly manage and avoid using expertise and expertise in activities that infringe upon the interests, security and order of the State; minimize the abuse of positions, powers and professional qualifications to commit violations such as the case of using the Internet to appropriate property, organizing gambling, illegally buying and selling invoices and Money laundering in Phu Tho province and some provinces and cities is being handled.\\n\\nProtecting children in the online environment\\n\\nAs for the regulation on the protection of children in the online environment, delegate Nguyen Thanh Cong (Ninh Binh) said that the Law should remove the provisions in Article 30 on this content, because basically these contents have been approved. clearly defined in the Law on Children 2016 (Article 33 provides for the right to access information; Article 54 provides for the protection of children in the online environment).\\n\\nThis content is also not really related to the topic of cyber security that the Law project regulates.

Currently, most of the internet access in families, at Internet business establishments does not distinguish between adults and children.\\n\\nAllowing children to freely participate in the online environment, exchange information with objects they do not know, visit dark websites, online games with inappropriate content, without family supervision teachers, will greatly influence the thoughts and actions of the children. Failure to control children\\'s participation in the online environment is no different from allowing them to have a virtual and deviant life, leading to a part of children having a lifestyle contrary to the nation\\'s moral and cultural traditions. . The use of cyberspace is seen as one more way to achieve development goals.\\n\\nHowever, adults have the ability to use appropriate content and be responsible for their own choices, and children, whether in real life or in the online environment, also need the guidance and protection of the Government. water, school, family.

      " \"On the afternoon of April 4, at the National Assembly House, the National Assembly Standing Committee held a conference of National Assembly deputies working full-time to discuss the draft Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\nOne of the issues that many delegates were interested in and commented on was the assurance of information security in cyberspace for foreign enterprises when providing telecommunications and Internet services in Vietnam.\\n\\nAccording to the Report on some major issues on the draft Law on Cybersecurity, many opinions agree with the provisions of Clause 4, Article 34 of the draft Law submitted by the Government as mandatory for foreign enterprises when providing telecommunications services. Information and communication networks in Vietnam must set up a representative agency or a server to manage Vietnamese user data in Vietnam.\\n\\nHowever, some opinions disagree with this regulation, because they think that it is difficult to ensure the feasibility, is not true to reality, increases the costs of foreign enterprises, makes it difficult to access activities. information and contrary to international commitments to which Vietnam is a member... it is recommended to study other management methods accordingly.\\n\\nThe National Assembly's Committee on Defense and Security said that this content has many different opinions, some foreign ambassadors in Vietnam and some organizations have comments. The National Defense and Security Committee has coordinated with the Foreign Affairs Committee to hold a conference to discuss and exchange with the ambassadors and clarify relevant recommendations.\\n\\nOn the basis of studying the international treaties to which Vietnam is a member, refer to the similar provisions of the laws of some countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and consider many aspects. , the National Defense and Security Committee proposed the adjustment plan.\\n\\nSpecifically, regarding the requirement to set up a data management server in the territory of Vietnam, the National Defense and Security Committee proposed not to stipulate this content in the draft Law to ensure feasibility and convenience for operations. of foreign enterprises when providing services to Vietnam.\\n\\nRegarding the requirement to set up a representative agency and store Vietnamese user data in the Vietnamese territory, the National Defense and Security Committee proposed to keep this content in the draft Law, but there are limitations on the subject matter. (enterprise) and data stored in Vietnam.\\n\\nSuch regulation will meet the requirements of protecting national sovereignty over electronic data and handling situations and acts in cyberspace that infringe upon national security, social order and safety; attach the obligations and responsibilities of foreign enterprises providing cross-border services in coordinating the provision of information and data for investigation, verification and handling of violations related to service users. in Viet Nam; ensure feasibility when coordinating to prevent and remove information against the Party and State, violating Vietnam's laws; effectively prevent destructive activities of domestic and foreign reactionaries and spies using cyberspace.\\n\\nSuch regulation is consistent with international treaties to which Vietnam is a member, in accordance with the 2013 Constitution of Vietnam, and at the same time, meets the requirements of the current practical situation.\\n\\nAccording to statistics of the Ministry of Public Security, as of January 2018, Google has rented 1,781 servers, Facebook has hired 441 servers of Vietnamese businesses to store data.\\n\\nIn addition, this regulation also creates a legal corridor for functional ministries and branches to strictly manage the activities of enterprises providing cross-border services when doing business in Vietnam; ensure payment sovereignty and prevent tax loss for these enterprises; at the same time, eliminate inequality in business activities between foreign enterprises and domestic enterprises.\\n\\nGiving opinions on the content of ensuring information security in cyberspace, delegate Nguyen Thanh Xuan (Can Tho) supported the view that foreign enterprises when providing telecommunications and Internet services in Vietnam must have their headquarters. or representative office in Vietnam and store in Vietnam for personal information of service users in Vietnam, other important data collected, generated from infrastructure exploitation activities Vietnam's national cyberspace according to the Government's regulations.\\n\\nHowever, delegate Nguyen Thanh Xuan still wondered about the feasibility of cloud computing technology operating on a global scale. star. Does this regulation go against international practice when the Internet is global network information?\\n\\nDelegate Dinh Duy Vuot (Gia Lai) said that the regulation required foreign businesses when providing telecommunications and internet services in Vietnam to set up a representative agency and a server to manage user data in Vietnam. (Clause 4, Article 34) is not feasible.\\n\\n[Establishing an important information system related to national security]\\n\\nAccording to delegate Dinh Duy Vuot, currently, the servers that regular users of Google, Facebook, YouTube... are located abroad. Besides, with current development technology, the server is not a specific machine, but according to the cloud algorithm, the server is a virtual machine that allows users tog access technology services from certain providers. Therefore, it is not possible to specify a server located in Vietnam. From the virtual server reality, the request to set up a representative office, the representative agency also needs to consider the feasibility.\\n\\nDelegate Dinh Duy Vuot agreed with the regulation of data storage in Vietnam for personal information of service users in Vietnam. This helps management agencies to research and firmly grasp information; remove content infringing upon national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\nAn issue also raised by many full-time National Assembly deputies is the concern of businesses in the telecommunications technology and digital content industries. Because, the draft Law has many binding contents that lead to a reduction in the benefits of enterprises, making them afraid to invest in and develop technology and services, and at the same time affect the privacy and freedom of citizens.\\n\\nTherefore, it was suggested that the Drafting Committee should study the provisions in the draft Law to harmonize national security, social order and safety and human rights as stipulated in the Law. Constitution. Especially, to encourage enterprises in the field of technology to invest and develop.\\n\\nConcluding the conference, Vice Chairman of the National Assembly Do Ba Ty emphasized that the draft Law on Cybersecurity is a difficult and complicated project, with many issues still having different opinions. The comments showed that some contents of the draft Law need to be further reviewed, perfected, and ensured feasibility. Cybersecurity protection measures must be tight and uniform but do not affect citizens' rights, production and business activities of enterprises.\\n\\nNational Assembly Vice Chairman Do Ba Ty said that after this meeting, the National Assembly Standing Committee will direct the drafting committee and the verifying agency to coordinate with relevant agencies to clarify relevant contents. , study, receive and consult the National Assembly delegations and the National Assembly Standing Committee before submitting the law bill at the upcoming 5th session.\"\n",

Only applying measures to ensure network information security under the Law on Cyberinformation Security will not satisfy the requirements set forth.\\n\\nRegarding network security management for foreign enterprises when providing telecommunications and Internet services in Vietnam (Clause 4, Article 34), some opinions disagree with the regulation requiring foreign enterprises to to set up a representative agency or a server to manage Vietnamese user data in the Vietnamese territory and propose to research other appropriate management methods.\\n\\nChairman of the National Assembly\\'s Committee for National Defense and Security Vo Trong Viet emphasized that in order to meet the requirements of State management on security and order, and to prevent, prevent and handle acts of using telecommunications networks and the Internet Cross-border entry into Vietnam violates the law, especially propaganda against the State, inciting opposition, sabotaging security, disrupting public order..., forcing some foreign enterprises to do business It is necessary for telecommunications and Internet services to have a head office or a representative office in Vietnam.\\n\\nCheck out important information related to national security 2\\nChairman of the National Assembly\\'s Committee for National Defense and Security Vo Trong Viet spoke at the meeting.

In addition, avoid restricting human rights and the right to access information as stipulated in the Constitution as well as international commitments to which Vietnam is a member.\\n\\nIt is necessary to regulate the \"state of national defense emergency\"\\n\\nAlso on the afternoon of January 10, the National Assembly Standing Committee gave opinions on issues with different opinions of the draft National Defense Law (amended).\\n\\nAccording to the Report on some issues asking for opinions on the draft National Defense Law (amended), with regard to the state of emergency on national defense, some opinions suggest considering this provision to be consistent with the Constitution. 2013 and agreed with the Law on Organization of the National Assembly, the Law on Government Organization, and the Law on Promulgation of Legal Documents, which only stipulates on the “state of emergency.”\\n\\nRepresentative of the law project inspection agency, Chairman of the National Assembly\\'s Committee on Defense and Security, Vo Trong Viet, said that the regulation \"state of emergency on national defense\" is aimed at institutionalizing Resolution No. September 22, 2008 of the Politburo \"on continuing to build the provinces and cities directly under the Central Government into solid defense areas in the new situation;\" concretize Clause 13, Article 70 of the 2013 Constitution “providing a state of emergency and other special measures to ensure national defense and security;” inheriting Article 31 of the current National Defense Law, and at the same time ensuring the uniformityArticle 21, Article 48 of the Law on Military Service 2014, Article 44 of the Law on Militia and Self-Defense in 2009 and Clause 1, Article 5 of the Law on Property Purchase and Requisition in 2008.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Article 1 of the Ordinance on State of Emergencies of 2000 only regulates the state of emergency related to disasters, natural disasters, epidemics or when there is a situation that seriously threatens national security and social order and safety. There is no provision for a state of emergency when the country is in direct danger of invasion or there has been an act of aggression or armed riot, but has not yet reached the point of declaring a state of war.\\n\\nIn fact, in recent years, ministries, branches and localities across the country, and the people\\'s armed forces have built a system of documents, plans and organized training and drills on \"national emergency.\" room.\" Therefore, it is necessary to prescribe a \"state of national emergency\" in the draft Law, creating a legal basis for national defense activities, ensuring national defense, building the people\\'s armed forces, ready to successfully deal with all wars of aggression.\\n\\nCheck out important information related to national security 3\\nMinister of Public Security To Lam spoke at the meeting. (Photo: Phuong Hoa/VNA)\\n\\nRegarding the National Defense and Security Council (Article 36 of the draft Law submitted by the Government), many opinions agree that the Ministry of Defense is the standing body of the National Defense and Security Council. Some suggestions suggest that the standing body is the Office of the President or both the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Public Security.\\n\\n[Building a cyber warfare force straight to modernity]\\n \\n\\nAccording to the Standing Committee of National Defense and Security Committee of the National Assembly, the Ministry of National Defense has the function of advising the Party and State on defense lines and strategies, military strategies; assisting the Government in state management of national defense; organize the performance of military, national defense and defense tasks. On the other hand, according to Decision No. 1188-QD/CTN dated June 3, 2014 of the State President, the Office of the President does not have the function to advise on matters in the fields of national defense, military, security, and insurance. defend the Fatherland. Therefore, the regulation that the Ministry of National Defense is the standing agency assisting the National Defense and Security Council as submitted by the draft Government Law is appropriate. However, in order to ensure strict compliance, the Standing Committee of the National Defense and Security Committee requested the National Assembly Standing Committee to consult with the National Defense and Security Council and competent authorities on this content.\\n\\nConcluding the meeting, National Assembly Vice Chairman Do Ba Ty pointed out that the National Defense and Security Council is a constitutional body; therefore, related issues must adhere to the provisions of the Constitution. The determination of the standing agency of the National Defense and Security Council requires research and consultation with the National Defense and Security Council.\\n\\nNational Assembly Vice Chairman Do Ba Ty asked the National Assembly\\'s Committee for National Defense and Security to coordinate with the drafting committee and relevant agencies to fully absorb comments to complete the draft law and send it to the delegation.

      " 'Continuing the program of the session on the morning of November 23, the National Assembly deputies discussed in the hall the draft Law on Cybersecurity. The necessity of promulgating the Law on Cybersecurity is a content analyzed and commented on by many National Assembly deputies at the discussion session.\\n\\nAccording to the report, the Law on Cybersecurity was born to meet the requirements of cybersecurity work in protecting national security and ensuring social order and safety; preventing and responding to threats to network security; overcome existing and limitations related to network security protection; fully and promptly institutionalize the Party\\'s guidelines and guidelines on cybersecurity; ensure conformity with the provisions of the 2013 Constitution on human rights, basic rights of citizens and defense of the Fatherland, and with international practices.\\n\\n[Forecast of possible cybersecurity threats in 2018]\\n\\nVerification of the draft Law, the National Assembly\\'s Committee on National Defense and Security approved the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity to protect national security, and at the same time demonstrated Vietnam\\'s responsibility in cooperating in solving cases. using cyberspace to terrorize and sabotage world security and peace.\\n\\nThrough the discussion, many delegates agreed with the need for a Law on Cybersecurity because in the current situation, cybersecurity is a matter of global concern, having a strong and comprehensive impact on various fields. of social life. Many countries promulgate laws, introduce policies to develop information technology, improve capacity to prevent, defend, prevent and attack in cyberspace to protect values, interests, security of the country. In our country, hostile forces, some types of criminals, and some other objects have been using cyberspace to commit acts of sabotage, profiteering or infringing upon, threatening to infringe upon the nation. defense, national security, social order and safety, property of the State, agencies, organizations and individuals, especially in the condition that the information technology infrastructure system is not synchronized. management still has many loopholes, the policy system is not synchronized.\\n\\nAgreeing with the need for this law, delegate Trieu Tuan Hai (Lang Son) analyzed that Vietnam is currently in the group of countries with the most cyberattacks. Hostile forces and criminals thoroughly take advantage of the internet\\'s utility, especially social networks, to conduct activities to infringe on security and order, causing instability in society. Vietnam has no legal documents on cyber security; Existing regulations on cyberinformation security are not enough to deter and prevent violations in cyberspace. Delegates expressed the view that the development and promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is very necessary and suitable for the world, thereby effectively contributing to solving difficulties and obstacles in the implementation of network security as well as prevention and combat against activities using the internet to infringe upon national security, social order and safety.\\n\\nAsking the question, why there is a Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bInformation Security but still have to develop a Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bSecurity, delegate Nguyen Huu Cau (Nghe An) analyzed that the scope of regulation of the two laws is completely different. Citing the Penal Code, which regulates all crimes, the Law on Anti-corruption or the Law on Drug Prevention and Control prescribes measures to prevent and fight more intensively with the types of crimes that the state sees. More dangerous, it is necessary to prioritize prevention and control, delegate Nguyen Huu Cau argued: The Law on Cyberinformation Security protects information security on the three most common attributes, that is, the integrity of information; confidentiality of information; availability of information. The draft Law on Cybersecurity focuses on combating malicious information, infringing upon national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations in the network environment. Affirming that this is the fundamental difference between the Law on Cyberinformation Security and the Law on Cybersecurity, delegate Nguyen Huu Cau found that it is normal to have more specialized laws on the network environment. The US, China, UK... already have a Law on Cybersecurity that the Drafting Board consulted when developing this law.\\n\\nDebating again with delegate Nguyen Huu Cau, delegate Nguyen Lan Hieu (An Giang) assessed that the cybersecurity protection measures in the draft Law on Cybersecurity have many similarities with the Law on Cyberinformation Security. . Delegate Nguyen Lan Hieu suggested that the National Assembly should complete and supplement existing laws, strengthen the management of social networks in the Civil Code, the Penal Code, and the Law on Access to Information to prevent fake news. ... In order to ensure a democratic development environment but still ensure national security, it is necessary to consider carefully and carefully before promulgating a law regulating this very sensitive field, the delegate suggested.\\n\\nWith the same view, delegate Nguyen Thi Kim Thuy (Da Nang) said that the reasons given by the Drafting Committee included: Meeting the requirements of cybersecurity work in protecting national security, ensuring order and security. all society; prevent and respond to threats to securitynetwork; overcoming existing and limitations related to network security protection to explain the need to enact the Law is not convincing. Delegates analyze the network as just a means and a space where acts of violating national security can take place. If it is said that there should be a separate law on cyber security, security in many other fields such as aviation security, food security ... must also be regulated by separate laws. \"As for the field of network information protection, this has been stipulated in the Law on Cyberinformation Security,\" the delegate stated.\\n\\nFor the reasons that the Law on Cybersecurity was born to fully and promptly institutionalize the Party\\'s guidelines and guidelines on cybersecurity; ensure conformity with the provisions of the 2013 Constitution on human rights, fundamental rights of citizens and defense of the Fatherland; To ensure conformity with international practices, delegate Thuy said that in fact the provisions on this issue in Chapter 2 of the draft Law on Cybersecurity are just concretization and guidance on the implementation of regulations on security and privacy. Network information security assurance is specified in Chapter 2 of the Law on Cyberinformation Security. These specific contents are specified in Chapter 4, Decree 85 of the Government on responsibility to ensure information system security.\\n\\nThe draft Law was first submitted to the National Assembly for consideration at this session. Through the comments of the National Assembly deputies, Minister of Public Security To Lam spoke, explained and clarified some of the issues raised by the delegates at the discussion session, thereby completing the draft Law submitted to the National Assembly. National Assembly at the next session.'\n",
      " 'Through discussion, delegates assessed that, after more than 15 years of implementation, the Ordinance on Protection of State Secrets has obtained many positive results, contributing to improving the efficiency of management and protection of State secrets.\\n\\nHowever, the actual situation has changed a lot, citizens\\' right to access and use information in socio-economic development is increasing.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the challenge of the industrial revolution 4.0 requires specific and appropriate solutions to ensure the protection of State secrets.\\n\\nDelegate Dinh Duy Vut (Gia Lai) said that in the past time, there has been a situation of revealing and leaking many State secrets, causing serious consequences, greatly affecting socio-economic development, ensuring security. national defense and security.\\n\\nFor example, the disclosure or leakage of secrets in the field of direction of the competent authority for the settlement of complaints and denunciations will cause difficulties in the proceedings; divulging, leaking information and secrets in construction bidding will cause group interests and personal interests.\\n\\n[The 4th Session, XIV National Assembly: Protecting State Secrets]\\n\\nTherefore, according to delegate Dinh Duy Vuot, the development and promulgation of the Law on Protection of State Secrets to overcome the shortcomings and limitations in the past time is an objective requirement.\\n\\nIn addition, many delegates also pointed out that, stemming from the reality of the protection of State secrets, the requirements of the international cooperation process of our Party and State today, it is necessary to develop a Law on Security. protecting State secrets in order to ensure compatibility with the Agreements on protection of confidential information between Vietnam and other countries; consistent with relevant international treaties to which Vietnam is a contracting party; meeting the requirements of domestic law, creating a basis for the implementation of Vietnam\\'s commitments in coordinating and sharing information, including information under the scope of State secrets.\\n\\nProposing to supplement regulations on conferences and seminars with contents related to State secrets\\n\\nRegarding the scope of regulation and subjects of application, the majority of delegates agreed with the provisions in the draft Law.\\n\\nAccordingly, the draft Law provides for State secrets, state secret protection activities and responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals in protecting State secrets; applicable to agencies, organizations and individuals involved in the protection of State secrets.\\n\\nSome argue that, in fact, the list of State secrets in some industries and fields includes documents from foreign countries or international organizations transferred to Vietnam.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to have a basis for managing and protecting State secrets in international cooperation activities on information exchange, the delegates proposed to supplement the scope of regulation for secret information provided by the agency. Foreign agencies, organizations and individuals transfer to Vietnam under international treaties and agreements to which Vietnam is a signatory.\\n\\nRegarding the list of State secrets, it is said that determining the list of State secrets is very difficult because it covers many fields.\\n\\nTherefore, it is necessary to clarify the concept of what is a State secret, to absolutely avoid abusing the protection of State secrets to conceal information for group purposes or personal interests.\\n\\nCiting a case where the authorities kept stamping documents and documents as confidential even though the information in those documents was not confidential, delegate Nghiem Vu Khai (Hai Phong) noted, the drafting board It is necessary to carefully consider which cases the documents are confidential and which are not.\\n\\nRegarding the organization of conferences, seminars and meetings with State secret contents, Clause 4, Article 14 of the draft Law stipulates: \"Conferences, seminars and meetings with State secret contents must be held in places where the contents are State secret. ensuring safety and the right audience. Information disseminated, researched and exchanged must conform to the approved content and protected in accordance with this Law.\"\\n\\nDelegate Huynh Thanh Canh (Binh Thuan) assessed that, in fact, the organization of meetings, conferences and seminars using and exchanging State secret information has not been strictly controlled on the venue. Organizations, participants, participants, means and equipment ensure safety, leading to the risk of revealing State secrets.\\n\\nTherefore, the delegate suggested that the drafting committee study, supplement and clarify regulations on conferences, seminars and meetings with State secret content in order to minimize the disclosure of State secret information through these activities.\\n\\nAvoid overlapping with relevant laws\\n\\nAt the working session on the afternoon of November 13, the National Assembly deputies discussed in groups and gave opinions on the draft Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe majority of delegates agreed with the need to enact the Law on Cybersecurity. Delegate Ngo Minh Chau (Ho Chi Minh component) emphasized, in the context that our country faces the threat from cybercriminals causing information insecurity; Some organizations and individuals are \"stalked\" by online attacks such as spyware, malicious code distribution to destroy data, steal information, etc.\\n\\nThe development of the Law project is very necessary to contribute to the prevention, prevention, response and remediation of consequences of cyber-attacks and terrorist activities.\\n\\nHowever, some National Assembly deputies noted that the provisions of the draft Law on Cybersecurity also overlap with the Law on Ciphers, the Law on Electronic Transactions, the Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200bInformation Security, and the Law on Cybersecurity.national defense, even overlapping state management functions between the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Information and Communications.\\n\\nAccording to delegate Nghiem Vu Khai (Hai Phong), network security is a long-term strategy and part of network information security, so it is necessary to consider and calculate the suitability and compatibility with the Law on Information Security. network.\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity Law Project must focus on regulating activities to protect national security, maintain social order and safety, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals in cyberspace and other organizations. provisions in the Law project should adhere to this goal.\\n\\nSharing the same opinion, delegate Nguyen Thanh Xuan (Can Tho) said that some provisions in the Law project overlap and overlap with other legal documents.\\n\\nCiting regulations on the appraisal competence of enterprises in the field of information technology, while the Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bInformation Security is the Ministry of Information and Communications, this draft Law stipulates that the Ministry of Public Security, the representative of the Ministry of Public Security. Nguyen Thanh Xuan suggested.\\n\\nTherefore, the drafting agency needs to clearly define the scope of adjustment of the law project, review regulations to overcome the above limitations, and ensure effective State management of this issue.\\n\\n[The National Assembly\\'s Committee on Defense and Security discusses the Law on Cybersecurity]\\n\\nAs for the State\\'s policy on cybersecurity (Article 4), some comments suggest additional policies on the protection of national cyber infrastructure, important information systems on national security family; training and developing human resources, ensuring regimes and policies for the network security force, investing and allocating funds to protect network security.\\n\\nRegarding the prohibited acts specified in Article 8 of the draft Law, a number of National Assembly deputies proposed to review the relevant acts specified in the Penal Code to include the prohibited provisions in this Law; design prohibition regulations in the direction of prohibiting acts of infringing upon, sabotaging or attacking information systems important to national security; prohibit the use of computer networks, telecommunications networks, electronic means and cyberspace to commit crimes infringing upon national security, social order and safety; prohibiting the use of computer networks, telecommunications networks, electronic means, and cyberspace to infringe upon human rights, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.'\n",

Mr. Vo Trong Viet requested the Drafting Board to study and review the contents of the draft Law to avoid overlapping regulations with other related laws.\\n\\nEnsuring the requirements of national security, social order and safety protection\\n\\nThe draft Law on Cybersecurity includes 7 chapters and 61 articles; in which specific regulations on network security protection, implementation of activities to ensure network security, development of network security human resources, ensuring conditions for implementation of network security work...\\n\\nPresenting the proposal of the Cybersecurity Law Project, Senior Lieutenant General To Lam, Politburo member, Minister of Public Security emphasized: The promulgation of the law is to meet the requirements of cybersecurity work in security protection. the country, ensuring social order and safety; preventing and responding to threats to network security; overcome limitations and existing problems related to network security protection.\\n\\nFrom the point of view of law-making, it is necessary to fully and promptly institutionalize the guidelines, guidelines and policies of the Party and State on cybersecurity; ensure the uniformity and consistency of the legal system, and reasonably determine the relationship between this law and related laws; selectively refer to international experiences to apply flexibly to the practical conditions of Vietnam.\\n\\nRegarding the regulatory scope of the law, the first line of opinion is that it is necessary to narrow the scope of regulation of the Law on Cybersecurity to focus on national security; However, there are also opinions, it is necessary to develop the regulatory scope of the Law on Cybersecurity, not only focusing on national security but also ensuring order and security.all society.\\n\\nIn this regard, Minister To Lam said that with the current strong development of science and technology, cyberspace has penetrated into all areas of social life and is present in most of the world. human activities. If cybersecurity protection only focuses on national security protection, it will miss many objects, objectives and contents that need to be protected, failing to meet the requirements of protecting national sovereignty, interests and security. , social order and safety, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\nTherefore, Minister To Lam said, the draft Law on Cybersecurity defines the scope of regulation as \"stipulating principles, measures, contents, activities and conditions to ensure the implementation of security protection activities\". cybersecurity; responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals participating in cyberspace and related to the network security protection activities of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam\" are consistent with the general trend of in the world and in the region, ensuring the protection of sovereignty, national security interests, and social order and safety.\\n\\nSpeaking at the session, National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan emphasized the necessity of promulgating the Law on Cybersecurity in the era of explosive development of information technology.\\n\\nCommenting on the draft law, the National Assembly Chairman said that the draft Law on Cybersecurity has many provisions related to other laws such as the Law on Cyberinformation Security, the Law on Electronic Transactions, the Law on Telecommunications, etc. Therefore, the President of the National Assembly suggested that the Law Drafting Board should analyze more deeply the current state of legislation in the field of cyber security, clarifying the need to promulgate the Law on Cybersecurity. Issues already specified in other laws do not need to be re-stipulated in the Law on Cybersecurity to avoid duplication and overlap.\\n\\nAccording to the National Assembly Chairman, many provisions in the draft Law on Cybersecurity are related to human rights and citizens\\' rights, so the draft law should follow the provisions of the Constitution and relevant laws. Regulations on restrictions on civil rights and human rights must be enshrined in this Law, not in sub-law documents.\\n\\nIn addition, the President of the National Assembly requested the Law Drafting Board to review and complete the provisions of the draft law on the scope of the law; on information systems important to national security; on prevention and response to network security risks and incidents.'\n",
      " 'Not only that, a representative of a foreign embassy in Hanoi expressed \"concern\" because he said that the Law \"affects the demand for localization and limits on multinational services as well as affects the development and growth of the Vietnamese economy”! And there have been criticisms affirming that the Law only directly affects enterprises in production and business of technology, digital services, and network security, and that is only a very small group compared to 561,064 enterprises already registered. Business Registration. As for the issue of improving the business environment, the reviewer also questioned: Without the Law on Cybersecurity, what is the legal basis to solve the fact that \"enterprises are still calling for help because they are being faked? brand on social networks, fake fanpage, crash website, report business account, get bad news from competitors, manipulate...?\".\\n\\nLoosing to slander, but those who speak out ignore the fact that advanced countries manage network security very closely.

However, at the end of 2017, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to repeal the law. This vote has faced strong opposition from the US public because they believe that the repeal \"will make the internet in the US become a playground \"only for the rich\", and the carriers have the power to do so. full power to squeeze, block bandwidth at will, to prioritize your \"child\" services and block other similar services\"...!\\n\\nIn short, just comparing with the German Law on Cybersecurity, we can see that the so-called \"democrats\" have committed very serious violations, so they oppose the National Assembly of Vietnam passing the Law on Cybersecurity. understandable too!'\n",

On September 7, 2018, the Ministry of Public Security issued Decision No. 5117/QD-BCA to establish a Drafting Board and an Editorial Team to develop Government Decrees guiding the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law. In order to ensure the set schedule, the Ministry of Public Security has directed the relevant functional agencies to urgently develop the drafts and carry out the order and procedures as prescribed.\\n\\nThe documents guiding the implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity are important and complex documents, directly related to the protection of national security, ensuring social order and safety, and protecting the sovereignty of the country. country. These sub-law documents are related to the functions and tasks of many ministries and branches and have received great attention from domestic and foreign agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\nAt the request of the Prime Minister, documents guiding the implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity need to be urgently completed to submit to the Government for consideration and promulgation, ensuring its implementation effect from January 1, 2019.\\n\\nThe provisions in the draft will continue to be consulted and revised to finalize and submit to the Government for consideration and decision. However, from the middle of October 2018 to now, that is, after the meeting of the Drafting Committee, the editorial team developed the Government\\'s Decrees guiding the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law (October 9, 2018). On the Internet appeared manuscripts copied, photographed, accompanied by articles criticizing, criticizing, even attributing with very heavy words.\\n\\nOn some websites such as RFA, VOA Vietnamese, BBC Vietnamese, a number of blogs and facebook pages of overseas individuals with opposing views and thoughts have posted and shared articles criticizing and disparaging such as: “The Communist Party of Vietnam is about to implement the Law on Cybersecurity to increase control over the people”; \"Draft Decree guiding the Law on Cybersecurity: Enterprises stand still\"; “Draft Decree guiding the implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity: The Law of Dictatorship”; “Ministry of Public Security drafts Decree guiding the Law on Cybersecurity, people are worried about personal information being controlled”…\\n\\nThere are even tens of thousands of people signing a \"petition\" asking for a postponement of the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law. These people cited a number of provisions in the Law and draft Decree, self-identified as \"intellectual\" or \"lawyer\", dissected the hairstyle of his beard on her chin, pretended to be knowledgeable about international law. voice \"towards a democratic society, internet freedom\", thereby evading cheating, referring to it in a very subjective and short-sighted way.\\n\\nThey attributed, after the revisions, \"the essence of this draft has not changed\", said that the scope of user data that is required to be stored in Vietnam is still very wide and \"the cost of the economy has not changed\". The economy to enforce the law is still enormous and absurd.”\\n\\nSome individuals even attributed it to their personal facebook page, saying that the draft regulation represents an abuse of power by the Cybersecurity Department, saying that the draft\\'s approach is to consider businesses, people, people who participate in social networks like… criminals!\\n\\nInferring the Law on Cybersecurity and the regulations that are forming in the decree \"not only has there been no solution to effectively protect Vietnam\\'s network against hackers, but it also puts it at higher risk when forcing data storage.\" individuals in a country with a low-tech background and a team of law enforcement officers are easy to abuse power”…\\n\\nIn fact, these reactions and criticisms all originate from cases that have been continuously criticized and opposed since the draft Law on Cybersecurity was consulted by organizations and individuals, that is, for several years now. . Now, before the Law on Cybersecurity is about to take effect and the guiding documents are being revised and completed, this number is juggled.\\n\\nIn terms of argument, the critics have rehashed four contents that they have made in the campaign against the Law on Cybersecurity for a long time. That is, they believe that the Law on Cybersecurity violates the right to privacy and freedom of expression and internet freedom, arguing that the enactment of the law is \"strangling the right to information online\".\\n\\nSecondly, they criticized the implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity, which will cause many high-tech enterprises and businesses operating on the Internet to face difficulties in terms of procedures, funding and security, causing them to stop doing business. in Vietnam, withdraw from Vietnam.\\n\\nThird, referring to the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law will turn the Ministry of Public Security, directly the CThe Cybersecurity Department has become a \"super-power\" agency, capable of monitoring the private life, political life and economic-financial transactions of all agencies, organizations, businesses and individuals.\\n\\nOn some pages, it is also satirical that from now on, people going to coffee and having breakfast are also controlled by cyber security! Fourth, from the above criticism, many people pushed the issue up to successfully attack Vietnam\\'s political regime as \"dictatorship\", \"totalitarian\".\\n\\nIt should be seen that, along with the Law on Special Zones, the Law on Cybersecurity are two laws that hostile and reactionary forces take advantage of as a front, hiding in the shadow of patriotism, freedom, democracy, and human rights to protect their country. oppose the Party, State and socialist regime in Vietnam, distribute the so-called \"open letters and petitions\", incite people to protest, oppose the regime, smash the offices of public authorities, create excuses make \"color revolution\".\\n\\nRecently, the Hate Change group launched a campaign called \"20 days to save the net\". Accordingly, those participating in this campaign were called by hostile and reactionary objects to write, post and sign \"petitions\" to put pressure on the government. They also set up a game of recording clips of melodious music (parodying Vietnamese songs, and lyrics with ironic content about the Law on Cybersecurity).\\n\\nIt is a fact that many articles online have been added, mutilated, and misrepresented by the subjects to distract readers, causing those who do not know the issue to be \"dragged\" into the circle. information vortex.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the agency in charge of network security is assigned by law the tasks within the permitted framework, that is, it has the right to request the network operator to provide personal data related to criminal investigation. handle violations of the law.\\n\\nIn other cases, all personal information is kept strictly confidential and cannot be interfered by a network security agency. This is the principle, so it cannot be said that this agency has become a “super power” that can monitor and make use of all information.\\n\\nCybersecurity is a global problem, advanced countries have also built and given specialized agencies under the Government specific powers, why don\\'t opponents jump in to criticize?\\n\\nAs revealed by former CIA employee Edward Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has direct access to the servers of a series of large companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, PalTalk, YouTube, etc. Skype, AOL… to track Internet activities around the world.\\n\\nIf we talk about human rights, it is clear that this practice shows that the NSA violates human rights on a global scale and that large internet service providers are controlled by the NSA.\\n\\nThe requirement to store important data in the country has also been regulated by many countries such as the US, Canada, Russia, Germany, China, Indonesia, Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Turkey. Turkey, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil…\\n\\nOn May 25, 2018, the European Union\\'s personal data protection regulations officially took effect, allowing citizens to control their personal data when participating in forums and social networks in the direction of: can look up, change, delete their personal information, service providers must disclose to customers how to use personal information, commit not to transfer personal data to third parties. third, if violated, the fine can be up to 20 million Euro or 40% of the global sales of the violating company.\\n\\nWith Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law, it is not compulsory for all agencies and organizations to comply with this regulation and it is not compulsory to store all data. Only some agencies, organizations and types of data must comply, on the basis of the requirements of security protection, public order, culture, ethics, fine customs and traditions of Vietnam.\\n\\nAccording to Lieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan, former Director of the Cybersecurity Department, when developing this regulation, the Drafting Board carefully reviewed the international commitments and treaties to which Vietnam is a member, including the Organization World Trade (WTO) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\\n\\nTherefore, regulations on data storage are not contrary to, do not violate commitments and do not hinder Vietnam\\'s implementation of international commitments. Because bilateral or multilateral commitments have principles on security, public order, culture and public health. The interests of countries participating in the commitments are always upheld and respected, without any commitments forcing us to sacrifice these interests.'\n",

The comments as well as public opinion were listened to, absorbed by the leaders of the Party and State, and promptly and quickly adjusted. In the corridor of the National Assembly on the morning of June 7, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Head of the National Steering Committee on the construction of special administrative-economic units answered the press, saying that he had received many messages, Letters and phone calls from intellectuals, National Assembly deputies... about the 99-year land lease in the draft law, especially intellectuals are very thoughtful. The Prime Minister emphasized that the Government listens to opinions and listens responsibly to intellectuals, people and National Assembly deputies. “When introducing such a bill, many people, intellectuals and overseas Vietnamese gave their opinions.

Those are two completely different things. Unfortunately, many people misunderstand this issue,\" the Prime Minister said.\\n\\nRight after that, on the morning of June 9, the Government Office released a press release saying: The Government agreed with the Standing Committee of the National Assembly (UBTVQH) on submitting to the National Assembly for consideration and postponement of the adoption of the Law on Units. special administrative-economic (special zone law) from the fifth session to the next session to have more time to research and perfect.

While deliberately not understanding, the actual provisions of the Law on Cybersecurity for this issue like.\\n\\nIn Clause 3, Article 26 on ensuring information security in cyberspace, it stipulates: “Domestic and foreign enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam. Nam has activities of collecting, exploiting, analyzing and processing data about personal information, data on the relationship of service users, data created by service users in Vietnam must store this data in Vietnam for the period specified by the Government. Foreign enterprises specified in this Clause must set up branches or representative offices in Vietnam.\\n\\nMany people oppose the regulation that must have a server located in our country.

Even the US, if they don\\'t have servers in their country, will the websites be free to operate? The state manages and stores data, in addition to national security, it is also to protect its citizens.\\n\\nFrom 2016 up to now, there have been tens of thousands of cyber attacks targeting our country\\'s information system.

They think that the law has invaded too much about their privacy, personal information.

The only worry is that calamity will befall this nation.”\\n\\nThe above excerpt was written on June 17, 2018 (five days after the National Assembly passed the Law on Cybersecurity) by a person who is quite famous on social networks and is the head of a book publishing company.\\n\\nOn May 20, 2021, on the occasion of the event that authorities discovered and arrested a large-scale fake book-making case, this person wrote on his personal page, as follows: \"Currently, Fanpage pages are running to sponsor and sell fake books day and night. of many units, authors and publishers have sent detailed lists and IPs to the Ministry of Public Security\\'s network security\".\\n\\nWHAT DOES THE ABOVE TWO PARTIES SAY?\\n\\nFirst of all, after three years of the Cybersecurity Law passed by the XIV National Assembly, Vietnamese people living in the Vietnamese territory do not have to \"break up\" on social networking platforms. Likewise, there is no such thing as \"substitute products seem to be available imported from another country\" and there is no such thing as \"slowly youtube will have to go\".\\n\\nIn short, three years after the introduction of the Law on Cybersecurity, it proved that his statements were completely baseless and untrue. Before the Law on Cybersecurity was passed, he was one of the loudest (on social media) to oppose this important legal document.\\n\\nAs a \"public figure\", each of his short articles or comments attracts thousands, even tens of thousands of interactions. These unfounded, even \"paranoid\" information, judgments and comments spread very quickly on technology platforms, social networks, exponentially.\\n\\nThree years later, ironically, it was none other than him who requested help from the authorities to apply the Cybersecurity Law to protect his publishing company from the problem of fake books and fake information in publications. Products.\\n\\nAfter his opinion was raised (May 20, 2021), some readers, in the \"comments\" section, questioned him, as follows: \"In the past, opposed to the Cybersecurity Law, why are you praying now? save it?\" In the feedback section, he only answered the opinions in favor of himself, and the questions, he was silent.\\n\\nOTHER FACTS RULES\\n\\nWhen a new event occurs, it is possible to immediately make an initial assessment of that event, which is completely normal. But if you go too far, lack alertness, and feel too emotional, the normal will become abnormal. As of June 2018, most of the people who have a little bit of fame or are very famous on social networks loudly oppose this legal document.\\n\\nThese people include many elements, businessmen, journalists, writers, theater artists, artists ... cai luong, singers, even some lawyers also objected. Thousands, even tens of thousands of articles, not only at home but also abroad, not only individuals but also some news agencies broadcasting in Vietnamese... have drawn, or rather, they \"imagined\". ” gives an extremely gray picture of the “doomsday” of social networks in the territory of Vietnam.\\n\\nUp to this point, the actual happenings prove that the above opinions have no basis, frankly, are wrong. Not only that, as once mentioned, it is the \"stars\" in the entertainment industry who once opposed the Cybersecurity Law, now they themselves have to ask for help from the competent forces to apply the law that they used to oppose. to punish those who humiliated them.\\n\\nWhen the new Law on Cybersecurity was passed, in an interview published in Tay Ninh Newspaper, Mr. Trinh Ngoc Phuong, a member of the XIV National Assembly, affirmed that this law ensures economic development, does not infringe on the right to freedom. individual as many people misunderstand.\\n\\n“The biggest goal of the Cybersecurity Law is to build a healthy cyberspace, ensure national defense and security, protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations, individuals, and agencies at home and abroad, and at the same time, contribute to economic development,\" Phuong said at the time of the interview.\\n\\nMr. Phuong said that European Union (EU) law has a more restrictive definition of what constitutes cybercrime, including access, system interference, data interference, illegal blocking. . Thus, cybersecurity encompasses many subjects related to criminal and civil law and the protection of honor or privacy as in the real world.\\n\\nWhat matters here is the online dimension, where illegal acts are created and the implications in the digital world. In Europe, Germany has a regulation on Cybersecurity Law very early. In July 2015, the German Parliament passed the Cybersecurity Law aimed atbetter protection for citizens and businesses in the digital age.\\n\\nGermany\\'s Cybersecurity Law requires companies and federal agencies to have a minimum network security standard, which must be certified by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). Companies must notify the Office of suspected cyberattacks on their systems. The law is relevant to sectors that are considered national “critical infrastructure”, such as transportation, healthcare, water, telecommunications providers, as well as financial companies and insurance.\\n\\nIn Singapore, the Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2017 allows the country\\'s Cybersecurity Authority to monitor and manage the nation\\'s cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Agency is authorized to take proactive measures to protect critical information infrastructure and rapidly respond to threats and incidents.\\n\\nThe Singapore government has listed 11 sectors as critical information infrastructure, including water, healthcare, maritime, telecommunications, information, energy and aviation. In addition, Singapore also signed a joint statement with Germany to strengthen cybersecurity cooperation between the two countries.\\n\\nFor Vietnam, why do we need to promulgate the Law on Cybersecurity? Vietnam is always in the group of countries with the most cyber attacks in the world. The state of information disturbance in cyberspace, distorting, smearing, slandering, insulting dignity, violating fine traditions and customs is rampant... Therefore, the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is widespread. is necessary. That is the general trend, in the world there are 138 countries with Cybersecurity Laws, of which 95 are developing countries.\\n\\nIt is unlikely that the Cybersecurity Law will seriously damage the Vietnamese economy, or that Vietnamese businesses will fail due to the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, as some people have said on social media recently. The Law on Cybersecurity will not generate sub-licenses, hindering the development of businesses, but on the contrary, can reduce costs if businesses set up content servers in Vietnam. Currently, Google and Facebook companies have placed many data storage machines in Vietnam.\\n\\nSince the end of 2016, the Vietnamese Government has been negotiating with these carriers to agree to set up a representative office in Vietnam, but there is no specific regulation. Therefore, the new Government proposes to put this provision into law. On the other hand, the Law on Cybersecurity requires network operators to prevent information from attacking Vietnam\\'s national security, attacking individuals\\' economic and political civil rights (Clause 1-Article 6).\\n\\nFrom the foregoing, it can be affirmed that, three years after it was passed by the National Assembly, the Law on Cybersecurity has not infringed upon individual freedom, has not hindered economic development, nor has social network service providers leaving Vietnam. In the face of the \"turbulence\" on social networks recently, in fact, the Law on Cybersecurity, even needs to be born earlier.'\n",
      " 'The development of cyberspace along with the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought enormous benefits in socio-economic development, as well as changing awareness, behavior and lifestyle. of human. However, besides the benefits, cyberspace also poses many risks and challenges, directly affecting the sovereignty, national security and social order and safety, the legitimate rights and interests of the people. organizations and individuals. Politically motivated cyber attacks on key information systems of countries are increasing, causing serious economic, defense and security losses. Cybercriminals are increasingly dangerous with many sophisticated and high-tech tricks, using malicious codes that apply artificial intelligence to attack and infiltrate. Cyberspace is becoming a favorable environment for foreign special agencies, individuals and terrorist organizations to contact, recruit forces, raise funds, spread anti-radical ideology, incite hatred hatred and violence.\\n\\nProtecting national rights, interests and security in cyberspace and responding to new threats from cyberspace has become a global issue, identified as a core and vital content in the process. protection and development in many countries around the world. On that basis, countries have promulgated legal documents and established codes of conduct to regulate behaviors and social relationships in cyberspace, contributing to improving security protection capacity. network and prevent, fight and handle illegal acts in cyberspace. To date, 138 countries (including 95 developing countries) have enacted the Cybersecurity Law. In the past 6 years, 23 countries have enacted more than 40 legal documents and sub-laws on cybersecurity. Typically, in September 2018, the US announced its Cybersecurity Strategy, which identified cyber security threats as the top threat to national security; declares readiness to respond with military measures if national cybersecurity is threatened or attacked. In December 2018, Australia enacted the Cybersecurity Law, which, in addition to emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity, also allows authorities to access encrypted data. of network operators.\\n\\nVietnam is in the group of countries with the fastest internet development in the world, and cyberspace in our country also presents many risks and challenges affecting national security and public order. society as a whole, namely:\\n\\n- Enemy and reactionary forces have increased the use of cyberspace to sabotage ideology, sabotage internal affairs, carry out plots of \"peaceful evolution\", cause national conflicts, incite protests and violence. to transform political institutions in Vietnam.\\n\\n- The problem of fake news, false information, bad news, toxic, damaging the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals is taking place seriously (1).\\n\\n- Our country\\'s network system is in the group of countries facing large-scale, high-intensity, serious and increasingly dangerous cyberattacks. Our country ranks 20th among the countries in the world where the network system is attacked by malware, 8th among the top 10 countries in the world in terms of local malware infection. From the end of 2015 up to now, 12,360 news sites and web portals with national domain names (.vn) of Vietnam have been attacked by hackers and changed their interfaces, including over 400 news sites and portals. electronic information of state agencies; There were 9,763 news sites attacked by foreign hackers and 2,597 news sites attacked by domestic hackers and groups (accounting for 21%).\\n\\n- The situation of misappropriating information, revealing state secrets, revealing personal information of internet users is worrying.\\n\\n- Criminal activities using high technology have increased in number of cases and sophisticated tricks, causing serious damage in many aspects and long-term consequences for society, including criminal activities, such as fraud. , online gambling organization (2).\\n\\n- State management of cyberspace faces many challenges with new online services, such as online payment, e-commerce, online games, virtual currency business, multi-level business. . At the same time, it raises a number of issues about national security, the risk of payment insecurity, network information security, such as the risk of network information insecurity, which facilitates the enemy to collect information. Intelligence; the risk of tax revenue loss, loss of payment space sovereignty; The situation of unequal competition between enterprises operating in the field of payment, domestic and foreign payment intermediaries creates an ideal environment for criminals using high technology to commit crimes, infringing upon administrative order. economy and social order.\\n\\n- The training of network security experts is still limited, not meeting the practical requirements set forth.\\n\\nTherefore, building and perfecting the legal system on cyber security, especially the Law on Cybersecurity, is an extremely urgent requirement. This is an important legal basis in the prevention, fight and handling of crimesillegal activities in cyberspace, protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals; creating a legal corridor to improve the protection of information systems important to national security, contributing to ensuring sovereignty, security and order and building a safe and healthy environment in cyberspace. .\\n\\nBasic contents of the Law on Cybersecurity\\n\\nMeeting the above practical requirements, the Law on Cybersecurity of Vietnam was passed by the XIV National Assembly at the 5th Session, with the rate of 86.86%, including 7 chapters and 43 articles, providing basic contents on security issues. protecting the network security for the national security information system; prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security; deploying network security protection activities and stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals. Detail:\\n\\nFirst, stipulate the basic concepts and policies of the State on network security; principles and measures to protect cybersecurity and national cyberspace; international cooperation on cybersecurity; prohibited acts on network security; handle violations of the law on network security. This is the basis for determining the scope of struggle, measures to be applied, violations and ways to prevent and handle these acts as well as conduct research and perfect the theory of security. network.\\n\\nSecond, fully regulate network security protection activities for information systems important for national security. With the regulations on appraisal, inspection, assessment of conditions, response and remediation of cybersecurity incidents specified in Chapter II, the important national security information system is closely protected from inside. With measures to protect network security, deal with acts of cyberattack, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, appropriation of information belonging to state secrets, acts against and destroying the State are prescribed in Chapter 2 of this Decree. I, Chapter III, important national security information systems are protected from the outside. This is an important legal basis, demonstrating protection commensurate with the role of the national security information system.\\n\\nThird, provide regulations to create a legal foundation in preventing, detecting, fighting and handling violations of the law, affecting national security, social order and safety, human rights and social security. and legitimate interests of organizations and individuals in cyberspace, such as drafting and posting information on cyberspace with propaganda content against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; inciting riots, disrupting security, disrupting public order, humiliating or slandering; infringing upon the economic management order; using cyberspace for cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, appropriation of state secrets, work secrets and personal information in cyberspace; using cyberspace, information technology and electronic means to commit acts of violating the law on security and order; This is a solid legal corridor for people to make friends, exchange, trade, do business or operate in cyberspace.\\n\\nFourth, focus on regulations on deploying cybersecurity protection activities in a synchronous and unified manner from the central to local levels, focusing on state agencies and political organizations, clearly stipulating the contents of deployment and inspection of network security for information systems of these agencies and organizations. National cyberspace infrastructure, international network gateway are also one of the key protected objects. With strict regulations and the synchronous participation of state agencies, businesses and organizations and individuals, the use of information to slander, humiliate, infringe upon the honor, dignity and reputation of others will be dealt with severely; Cybersecurity violations will be detected and warned in a timely manner. Cybersecurity research and development activities, technology development, products, services and applications to protect network security, improve cyber security autonomy and protect children in space The network is also regulated in detail, which is an important legal foundation for implementing current and future cybersecurity work.\\n\\nFifth, create an important legal basis to implement the State\\'s policy on the protection of personal data and national data in cyberspace. In order to strictly manage and protect our country\\'s data in cyberspace, the Law on Cybersecurity stipulates that domestic and foreign enterprises provide services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam that collect, exploit, analyze and process data about personal information, data on the relationship of service users, data collected Service users in Vietnam must store this data in Vietnam for the period specified by the Government of Vietnam. This is an important legal basis to improve the efficiency of state management, fight against crime in the face of complicated developments in cross-border service provision, e-commerce, money business. virtual, electronic money last time.\\n\\nSixth, creating a legal basis for the work of securitydeploying network security protection activities, building and forming a specialized force for network security protection capable of meeting the requirements of the actual situation, prioritizing training high-quality cybersecurity human resources . Focusing on education, training and dissemination of cybersecurity knowledge to agencies, organizations and individuals with the goal of participating in a safe and healthy cyberspace, minimizing risks and negative impacts. , maximize efficiency.\\n\\nSeventh, clearly stipulate the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals when participating in activities in cyberspace, focusing on determining the responsibilities of the specialized cybersecurity protection force located at the Ministry of Public Security. Police, Ministry of Defense.\\n\\nGroups of measures to protect network security\\n\\nTo protect national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals, the Law on Cybersecurity stipulates four groups of measures to protect network security, including group network security measures; group of administrative measures; group of investigation and prosecution measures according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code; and a group of other measures as prescribed by law. Detail:\\n\\nFirst, the group of network security measures, including 7 measures:\\n\\n- Cybersecurity appraisal is the activity of reviewing and evaluating the contents of network security to serve as a basis for deciding to build or upgrade an information system.\\n\\n- Assessment of network security conditions is an activity to consider the network security response of an information system before it is put into operation and use.\\n\\nCybersecurity inspection is an activity to determine the current state of network security of an information system, information system infrastructure, or information stored, processed or transmitted in an information system in order to prevent , detect and handle threats to network security and propose plans and measures to ensure the normal operation of the information system.\\n\\n- Cybersecurity monitoring is the activity of collecting and analyzing the situation in order to identify threats to network security, network security incidents, weaknesses, security holes, malicious code, and malicious hardware for warning. report, fix, handle.\\n\\n- Responding to and overcoming network security incidents for information systems is the activity of detecting and identifying network security incidents; protect the scene, collect evidence; blockade, limit the scope of network security incidents, limit damage caused by network security incidents; identification of targets, objects and scope of rescue; verify, analyze, evaluate and classify network security incidents; implementing plans to respond to and overcome network security incidents; cause verification and traceability; investigate and handle according to the provisions of law.\\n\\nFighting for the protection of network security is an organized activity carried out by a specialized force for cybersecurity protection in cyberspace in order to protect national security and ensure social order and safety.\\n\\nUse of cryptography to protect network information means cryptographic measures to protect network information when transmitting information and documents containing state secret content in cyberspace.\\n\\nSecond, group of administrative measures, including 5 measures:\\n\\n- Prevent, request to suspend or stop providing network information;\\n\\n- Suspend, temporarily suspend activities of establishing, providing and using telecommunications networks, internet, radio transmitters and receivers;\\n\\n- Request the removal of illegal or untrue information;\\n\\n- Blocking, restricting operation, suspending, temporarily suspending or requesting to stop operation of information systems;\\n\\n- Revocation of domain names.\\n\\nThird, the group of investigation and prosecution measures according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, including:\\n\\n- Electronic data collection activities related to violations;\\n\\n- Procedures for prosecution, investigation, prosecution and trial according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.\\n\\nFourth, the group of other measures, including those prescribed by the National Security Law, such as people mobilization, diplomacy, economy, science - technology, profession, and armament; provisions of the law on handling administrative violations, such as administrative sanctions (warnings, fines), additional penalties (deprivation of the right to use permits, confiscation of material evidences of violations), measures to Other measures (forcibly shutting down, suspending, temporarily suspending, forcibly restoring the old state, forcibly deleting, removing, or destroying information and information content)'\n",

      " 'Speaking at a discussion in the hall on the Cybersecurity bill this morning (November 23), delegate Nguyen Thi Kim Thuy (Da Nang) gave many reasons that it was not necessary to have this law because of the coincidence. consistent with the contents prescribed by previous laws.\\n\\nAccording to this delegate, talking about the necessity, the draft law gives 10 reasons but they are not convincing. For example, the first 3 reasons are \"for national security\", according to Ms. Kim Thuy, there is an adjustment of the National Security Law. As for the field of network information protection, it is also regulated in the Law on Cyberinformation Security. \"The provisions of the two laws of National Security and Information Security have covered the issue of cyberinformation security, assuming that some regulations are still omitted, they can also be additionally reviewed,\" said delegate Thuy. expressed.\\n\\nSimilarly, the three reasons related to the important information system of national security are specified in chapter 2 of this bill, according to Ms. Thuy, just concretizing guidance on information security regulations. network in Chapter 2 of the Law on Cyberinformation Security and Decree 85 guiding the law. On the other hand, the concept of an important national security information system in Article 3 of the bill also overlaps with the concept of a national important information system in Article 3 of the Law on Cyberinformation Security. \"Therefore, it is recommended that the Government and the National Assembly carefully consider whether there is a need for a separate law or only amend the Law on Cyberinformation Security and National Security,\" the Da Nang delegation said.\\n\\nRegarding the unification with the legal system, according to Ms. Kim Thuy, if there is more of this law, it will lead to a matter of two management agencies, both overlapping and potentially making it difficult for the people. For example, Article 9 of the draft Cybersecurity Law stipulates that the Government stipulates in detail the list of important information systems for national security while Clause 2, Article 26 of the Law on Cyberinformation Security stipulates The Ministry of Information and Communications shall assume the prime responsibility for coordinating with other ministries to develop a list of important national security information systems and submit them to the Prime Minister for promulgation.To do this, in May 2017, the Prime Minister issued Decision 632. If this law is passed, it will definitely have to amend the Law on Cyberinformation Security, amend Decision 632, otherwise, there will be 2 ministries to jointly manage this issue, \"said Ms. Thuy.\\n\\nSimilarly, another example cited by the female delegate is Clause 3, Article 11 of the draft Cybersecurity Law, which stipulates the Ministry of Public Security to assess the capacity and conditions for enterprises providing cyberinformation security services to customers. national security system. But before that, Clause 1, Article 44 of the Law on Cyberinformation Security also assigned the Ministry of Information and Communications to preside over the appraisal and issue licenses for trading network information security products and services. \"That is, a service-providing enterprise has to be assessed twice for its business capacity and conditions by two different management agencies. This not only makes administrative procedures cumbersome and unreasonable but also leads to If the appraisal results of the two management agencies contradict each other, if the enterprise only receives one license, the appraisal of the other ministry has no meaning. The license of 1 ministry does not make sense,\" said delegate Thuy.\\n\\nAdd more uncertain or cumbersome Cybersecurity law! - 1 . photo\\nRELATED NEWS\\n\\'Getting\\' Google, Facebook to set up servers in Vietnam, domestic enterprises are at a disadvantage\\nNot only the business community is concerned, even experts are expressing concern and insecurity about the draft Law on Cybersecurity when discussing at a seminar organized by the Digital Media Association on November 21.\\n\\nStill according to NE Thuy, Article 16 of this bill stipulates the assessment of conformity with regulations on cyber security for information systems important for national security, while the assessment of conformity with standards and regulations on information security is required. Network information has been specified in Article 39 of the Law on Cyberinformation Security. If the Law on Cybersecurity is passed, a product will be assessed for conformity twice. \"This means that the National Assembly will violate the principle of 1, only assigning one agency to assume the prime responsibility for implementation and take the main responsibility\", Ms. Thuy emphasized.\\nIn addition, with the conformity of the draft law with international treaties, according to Ms. Kim Thuy, Article 34 of this draft stipulates that network service providers must set up servers in Vietnam, which is contrary to the organization\\'s commitments. WTO organization and Vietnam - EU trade agreement, because according to these commitments, cross-border telecommunications services are not limited to market access, except in some specific cases, but in the cases of exclusion. It also does not stipulate that there must be a representative office in the territory of Vietnam.'\n",
      " 'The most disturbing thing is that the scope and subject of regulation of two laws: the 2015 Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bInformation Security and the Draft Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bSecurity, there is no clear delineation.\\n\\nSpecifically, the Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bInformation Security stipulates: “Information system is a collection of hardware, software and databases established for the purpose of creating, providing, transmitting, collecting and processing manage, store and exchange information on the network”. The draft Law on Cybersecurity states that \"National cyber infrastructure is a system of equipment serving the creation, transmission, collection, processing, storage and exchange of information\". Meanwhile, in other countries, in legal terms, the concept of \"cyber security\" is used with the same meaning for an object: \"cyberspace\".\\n\\nDebating the draft Cybersecurity Law: Trampling, overlapping and wasteful - photo 1\\nRELATED NEWS\\nDebating regulations forcing Google, Facebook to set up servers in Vietnam\\nRegulations on foreign enterprises such as\\nGoogle, Facebook\\nWhen providing internet telecommunications services in Vietnam, the server representative agency must be the most \"hot spot\" when the National Assembly discusses the Cybersecurity bill on the morning of November 23.\\n\\nThe same subject of regulation, but the new draft stipulates that the Ministry of Public Security is the state management agency and the focal point for certification and licensing of national cybersecurity standards and regulations. Meanwhile, the Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bInformation Security 2015 assigns that job to the Ministry of Information and Communications, the conflict of authority from the overlapping scope of regulation is very clear.\\n\\nFor example, when a network incident occurs, there is a conflict of clues in the matter of rescue. The Law on Cyberinformation Security, Article 14, Clause 4, Point b stipulates: The Ministry of Information and Communications shall assume the prime responsibility for coordinating emergency response work to ensure national cyberinformation security. But the draft Law on Cybersecurity says: The Ministry of Public Security coordinates activities to respond to and remedy cybersecurity incidents that occur to information systems important to national security or when emergency situations occur. on network security, network security incidents... (Article 20, Clause 4). So will the enforcement agencies listen to the Ministry of Information and Communications or the Ministry of Public Security?\\n\\nAlso, if the certification of technical-regulation conformity is not amended, when the law takes effect, if it is required to certify the technical-regulation conformity, the enterprise needs to \"find whom\"? If you have to find both sets for 1 license, assuming the decision is \"contradictory\", which agency will arbitrate \"right and wrong\"? Enterprises will receive enough, be embarrassed when implementing, incur additional costs; and at the same time bear the legal risk of being controlled by both ministries.\\n\\nWhile the Government is upholding the spirit of innovation, reducing costs for businesses; encouraging high-tech development and technology start-ups - the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law have the potential to put \"nails\" under the carpet. The law therefore may not achieve the goal of ensuring national security and safety; at the same time creating a new wave of \"migration\" of enterprises to other countries for business registration which is both convenient and safe.\\n\\nDebating the draft Law on Cybersecurity: Trampling, overlapping and wasteful - photo 2\\nRELATED NEWS\\nAdd more uncertain or cumbersome Cybersecurity law!\\nDelegate Kim Thuy thinks that we already have 2 solid locks for safety\\nnetwork information\\n, if you add 1 key but give it to another person to hold the key, is it more cumbersome or more secure?\\n\\n\"Birth\" more licenses\\n\\nAccording to international experience, no country has introduced two separate concepts of cyber security and safety.

Without a “licensed” that confirms compliance, they will not be able to bring the product to market.\\n\\nFrom the point of view of hardware dealers, it is a risk of adding costs to the importer, ultimately falling on the consumer. Because Vietnamese enterprises hardly produce hardware, but have to import. So with global business firms like Apple, for example, will they produce their own iPhones that meet \"Vietnamese standards\"? Most likely not, and importers will have to do it.

According to economic analysis, if strict implementation of regulations on data storage, setting up servers in Vietnam (as specified at point d, clause 2, article 26), can reduce 1.7% increase GDP growth, 3.1% decrease in foreign investment in Vietnam.\\n\\nAfter revisions, the draft Law on Cybersecurity submitted to the 24th session of the National Assembly Standing Committee changed the language and spelling, thereby not directly requesting to set up servers and data in Vietnam, but instead requires \"stored in Vietnam for personal information of service users in Vietnam\". This, according to VDCA, still has the legal implication that the data and servers must be located in Vietnam.\\n\\nVDCA proposes to cancel the above regulation for the following reasons: negative impact on economic development through restrictions on international data exchange; increase costs, reduce the ability of domestic enterprises to take advantage of technological development. According to VDCA, although the direct costs of implementing this regulation may fall to the group of foreign enterprises, indirect costs will be distributed to the entire Vietnamese business and economy, affecting the environment. business investment, reducing investment attraction for foreign enterprises in Vietnam.

Cybersecurity research and development activities, technology development, products, services and applications to protect network security, improve cyber security autonomy and protect children in space networks are also detailed in this Chapter.\\nCurrently, our country's data in cyberspace has been widely used for profit purposes, but the State does not have enough legal corridors to manage, even being used for political conspiracy. rule or violate the law. In order to strictly manage and protect our country's data in cyberspace, the Law on Cybersecurity stipulates that domestic and foreign enterprises provide services on the telecommunications network, the Internet and valuable services. increase in cyberspace in Vietnam with activities of collecting, exploiting, analyzing and processing data about personal information, data on the relationship of service users, data collected by users Services created in Vietnam must store this data in Vietnam for the period specified by the Government.\\nHuman resources to protect network security is one of the decisive factors for the success or failure of network security protection. Chapter V of the Law fully stipulates the contents to ensure the implementation of network security protection activities, identifies a specialized force for network security protection, prioritizes training of high-quality cyber security human resources, attach importance to education, training and dissemination of knowledge about network security.\\nWith such a purpose, meaning and effect, the Law on Cybersecurity was born not only as a necessary legal framework in the 4.0 technology era but also as an urgent requirement to ensure a safe environment against threats. permanent damage in cyberspace, both in terms of technology and information content\"\n",
      " 'The Law on Cybersecurity was approved by the XIV National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam at its 5th session on June 12, 2018 with the approval rate of 86.86% of the delegates, with the symbol number 24. /2018/QH14. The Law takes effect from January 1, 2019, stipulating the basic contents of cybersecurity protection for information systems important for national security; prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security; deploying network security protection activities and stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals.\\nWith the scope of regulation of the Cybersecurity Law, organizations and individuals operating in a national cyber environment will be guaranteed to be safer and healthier than before, minimizing factors and risks. opportunities to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals such as: having personal information stolen; being deceived, appropriating property; being slandered, humiliated, attacked and defamed; restrict malicious code; gradually eliminate acts of gambling, betting, propagating depraved cultural products, inciting violence, prostitution and other illegal acts in cyberspace; strictly protect personal data in cyberspace; children are protected in cyberspace…; ensure an equal business environment between domestic enterprises and foreign enterprises in terms of management, compatibility with the provisions of law and responsibilities and obligations to be performed.\\n\\nAccording to Clause 1, Article 2 of the Law on Cybersecurity: “Cybersecurity is the assurance that operations in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of the State. laws of agencies, organizations and individuals\". From this concept and through studying the contents of the Cybersecurity Law, it can be seen that the Cybersecurity Law directly protects the following five human rights: (1) The right to life, the right to individual freedom; the right to equality before the law and to be protected by the law; (2) The right to be free from interference in privacy, family, residence or correspondence; (3) The right not to be infringed upon the honor or reputation of the individual; (4) Citizens\\' right to freedom of thought, belief and religion; (5) Citizens\\' right to freedom of speech and expression. The protection of these rights is reflected in the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law as follows:\\n\\nArticle 8 of the Law on Cybersecurity provides for prohibited acts in cybersecurity such as: (1) Acts of using cyberspace, information technology, and electronic means to violate the law on national security family, social order and safety; Organizing, operating, colluding, instigating, bribing, deceiving, enticing, training and training people against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; Distorting history; false information, etc. (2) Performing cyber attacks, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cybercriminals; causing incidents, attacks, intrusions, hijacking, falsifying, interrupting, stalling, crippling or sabotaging information systems important to national security, etc. (3) Producing, distributing using tools, means, software or obstructing or disrupting the operation of telecommunications networks, the Internet, computer networks, information systems, etc. (4) Opposing or obstructing operations of the network security protection force; illegally attacking or disabling network security protection measures; (5) Taking advantage of or abusing cybersecurity protection activities to infringe upon the sovereignty, interests, national security, social order and safety, lawful rights and interests of agencies, organizations, individuals for personal gain. This provision represents protection when participating in cyberspace activities against malicious information that infringes upon honor, reputation, dignity, cyberattacks, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism or other acts that affect their lawful rights and interests. With the prohibited acts in the Cybersecurity Law that clearly show equality before the law, these acts are no exception to anyone, domestic or foreign individual.

Additional services on cyberspace in Vietnam are responsible for eliminating the sources of bad information by not or stopping providing services to these subjects. At the same time, it helps to protect people\\'s personal information, personal secrets, and avoid being collected and abused (in case personal data of Facebook users is abused for political activities). By requiring some foreign businesses to set up branches and representative offices, that is, having a legal entity in Vietnam will help people have the right to manage, use and complain about their data.\\n\\nChildren are especially protected in cyberspace. The contents of child protection in cyberspace are specified in Article 29 of the Law on Cybersecurity. In particular, it requires information system owners, enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace, agencies, organizations, parents, teachers, people care and other individuals responsible for the protection of children when children participate in cyberspace; requesting the specialized cyber security force to apply necessary measures to protect children\\'s rights in cyberspace.\\n\\nAccording to Articles 27, 32, 33, 34 of the Law on Cybersecurity, which regulates research and development of network security; recruitment, training and development of network security guards; education and fostering of knowledge and operations on network security; dissemination of knowledge about network security.

      " 'First of all, it must be affirmed that the Law on Cybersecurity does not prohibit social network participants from voicing and expressing their personal views, but users of social networks must always comply with the Constitution and the law. The Law on Cybersecurity only regulates and handles information that violates the law.\\n\\nRecently, the XIV National Assembly passed the Law on Cybersecurity with 86.86% of the delegates agreeing. The formulation and promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity comes from the context of the domestic cybersecurity situation and the requirement to protect national security, State secrets, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests. of organizations and individuals, in accordance with international practices and the provisions of the Constitution. However, in the past time, some opponents have carried out propaganda activities, distorting with statements such as the Cybersecurity Law \"against humanity\", \"silence democracy\", \"suppression of dissent\". political opinions\", \"abuse of power\", \"banning the use of Facebook, Google\"... These are completely fabricated and distorted information, with the aim of obstructing or causing panic and suspicion among the masses. people towards the Party\\'s guidelines, the State\\'s policies and laws on cyber security.\\n\\nFirst of all, it must be affirmed that the Law on Cybersecurity does not prohibit social network participants from voicing and expressing their personal views, but users of social networks must always comply with the Constitution and the law. The Law on Cybersecurity only regulates and handles information that violates the law.\\n\\nExpressing personal opinions is an indispensable need of every human being, especially in the era of the Internet, mobile communication devices, and explosive development of social networks. made easier than ever. However, the posting of false information, \"slashing\", \"throwing stones\" indiscriminately by \"keyboard heroes\" has left very dangerous consequences: Spreading false information, causing panic. bring public opinion; inciting acts of an extreme or violent nature, leading to social disorder and violation of the law. Or, the phenomenon of releasing photos and clips that insult the dignity and honor of others on social networks makes victims confused and scared, and has acted dangerously, threatening their own lives...\\n\\nHowever, for a long time, Vietnamese law has not had specific regulations to prevent, fight and handle acts of using cyberspace to infringe upon national security, social order and safety. , legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals... This leads to the fact that people do not understand, are not aware of or intentionally commit wrong acts, and the authorities are not fair enough. legal instruments to handle.\\n\\nThose shortcomings and limitations in law protection in cyberspace will be overcome when the Law on Cybersecurity takes effect. Article 16 of the Law on Cybersecurity specifically stipulates 5 groups of information in cyberspace that must be removed when an organization or individual drafts, posts, or distributes information at the request of a specialized security force. and take responsibility according to the provisions of law, including: (1) Information containing propaganda content against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (defaming the people\\'s administration; insulting the nation, the national flag) , national emblem, national anthem, great man, leader, celebrity, national hero...). (2) Information with content that incites riots, disrupts security, disrupts public order (calling, mobilizing, instigating, threatening, attracting crowds to cause trouble, etc.). (3) Information with humiliating or slanderous content (seriously offending the honor, reputation, and dignity of others, etc.). (4) Information with content that infringes upon the economic management order (fabricated or untrue information about products and goods, etc.). (5) Information with fabricated and untrue content causes confusion among the people, causes damage to socio-economic activities, and causes difficulties for the operation of state agencies.\\n\\nTherefore, according to the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, people can completely express their opinions and views on cyberspace, but they must not take advantage of that to propagate against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Vietnamese meaning; inciting riots, disrupting security and disrupting public order; humiliate, slander; infringing upon the order of economic management…\\n\\nAt the same time, the Cybersecurity Law strengthens the protection of human rights and citizens\\' rights in accordance with the Constitution.

This is completely in line with the spirit of the 2013 Constitution.\\n\\nParty committees at all levels shall gather information, propagate and explain to cadres, party members and people the basic contents of the Law on Cybersecurity; clarify the necessity, purpose and meaning of the Law on Cybersecurity; fight and oppose fabricated allegations and distort the contents of the Cybersecurity Law.

      " 'It is estimated that, at the current growth rate, within the next one year, Southeast Asia will have at least 460 million Internet users. Vietnam alone, according to statistics at the end of last year, the number of Internet users accounted for 67% of the population (equivalent to 64 million people), ranking 13th out of 20 countries with the largest number of Internet users in the world.\\n\\nAs all human activities in fields, from politics, economy, society to security and national defense are significantly dependent on the operation of computers and Internet-connected devices, the protection of Ensuring network security is becoming one of the challenges of the times in Southeast Asia in general as well as in Vietnam in particular.\\n\\nIn addition to the undeniable great benefits such as providing information, sharing, exchanging, connecting people, cooperating and exchanging, the Internet has also become an environment for new threats. It can be a threat to the interests of individuals, households and businesses, can even threaten national security and interests, harm economic growth, prosperity and stability. of an entire region.\\n\\nThese threats are diverse, ranging from cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, cyberwar, information misappropriation, to fabricated information, fraud, libel, incitement to violence, misrepresentation, against the regime,...\\n\\nIn many cases, cyberspace has become a \"safe haven\" for criminals and law-breakers, extremist terrorist groups, anti-sabotage and hostile forces.\\n\\nThere is no shortage of real-life examples, where cyberspace has been turned into a \"fertile ground\" to spread false information, disrupt the market, and infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. , even more serious, causing internal division, undermining the solidarity bloc, causing social disorder and disorder.\\n\\nIt is no coincidence that people call criminal acts in cyberspace the \"war without gunfire\". Economic damage alone, last year, the world \"lost\" 600 billion USD due to cybercrime, not to mention the incalculable losses such as insecurity, personal information security or national security. family is violated.\\n\\nRemember, social media networks have been used by opposition forces to implement the so-called Arab Spring, inciting waves of protests, causing riots and moving towards overthrowing the constitutional governments in Tunisia. , Egypt, Yemen, Libya,…\\n\\nAccording to an investigation by Al Jazeera, up to 90% of respondents in Tunisia and Egypt admitted that they had used the social network Facebook to spread calls for protests. Inciting fake, fabricated and distorted information was spread quickly, making people not alert enough and caught up in the wave of riots and subversion.\\n\\nAccording to Professor Vladimir Kolotov, Director of the Ho Chi Minh Research Institute of Saint Petersburg State University in Russia, the lack of security in the field of cybersecurity poses a threat not only to cyber sovereignty, but also for the real sovereignty of the country.\\n\\nTherefore, the establishment of order and regulation of cyberspace sovereignty by laws is a real and legitimate need for all countries, and many countries in the world. This will be an effective legal tool to promptly prevent potential risks and challenges from cyberspace.\\n\\nTherefore, the fact that the National Assembly of Vietnam has just passed the Law on Cybersecurity is essential because according to the International Index on Cybersecurity published at the end of 2017, Vietnam is currently ranked 101/193 countries in the world. This index is evaluated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) based on many criteria such as legal framework, organizational capacity related to national cyber security strategy, technical capacity, cooperation at home and abroad...\\n\\nIt is worth noting that Vietnam has one of the lowest levels of cybersecurity in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Excluding Southeast Asian countries that are at the forefront of cybersecurity management such as Singapore, which topped the ITU rankings, or Thailand and Malaysia at 22nd, Vietnam is also behind Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. .\\n\\nThis shows the fact that Vietnam is \"later\" than many regional countries in making regulations on cybersecurity and improving safety in cyberspace.\\n\\nAccording to Bangladesh\\'s Dhakatribune, with the passage of the Cybersecurity Law, Vietnam is exercising its right to protect its citizens from all manipulations, contributing to political stability and social order, thereby bringing commitments. stronger connection from foreign investors, helping to maintain a stable economic growth rate.\\n\\nIn all aspects, cyberspace needs to be developed in a healthy and safe manner to serve the legitimate rights and interests of the majority of the people, and to ensure stability and development of the country.\\n\\nIn the face of the global spread of the Internet, the creation of a more transparent legal corridor by countries, including Vietnam, will contribute to promoting the positive points of the Internet, while minimizing the negative aspects. its impact on society, perception, ideology, andthanks to security, national sovereignty and the interests of the people; do not allow social media networks to be used by opposition forces to become tools to carry out evil schemes.'\n",
      " 'The Law on Cybersecurity was passed by the National Assembly of Vietnam on June 12, 2018 and officially took effect from January 1, 2019, consisting of 07 chapters and 43 articles, stipulating the basic contents of security protection. network security for information systems important to national security; prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security; deploying network security protection activities and stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\nThis is a very meaningful law project, which is an important legal basis to protect national security; maintaining social order and safety, and sanctioning law-breaking acts in cyberspace.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity will further tighten activities in the network environment by prohibiting acts that cause network insecurity. This requires each internet and social network user to understand their rights and obligations when participating in activities in the cyberspace.\\n\\nAccordingly, the Law on Cybersecurity stipulates 06 groups of acts that are strictly prohibited to be performed in cyberspace: (1) Using cyberspace, information technology, and electronic means to violate national security and order Social security; Activities against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; Distorting history, insulting religion, discriminating on gender, racist; Inciting riots, disrupting security or disrupting public order; Misinformation, humiliation, slander; Infringing upon economic management order, prostitution, social evils, human trafficking and instigating, enticing and inciting others to commit crimes.

They are concerned because they misunderstand that the Cybersecurity Law limits their personal freedom in cyberspace, while in fact the Law regulates prohibited behaviors that Facebook users often commit such as false information. truth, causing confusion among the people, causing damage to socio-economic activities, causing difficulties for the operation of state agencies or official duty performers; giving false information, fabricating, insulting human dignity, etc., according to 29 articles of the Penal Code, they will be handled. Clause 1 – Article 17 stipulates that users of social networks are not allowed to do the following: “Put on cyberspace information of personal secrets, family secrets, and private life contrary to the provisions of law.” . The Law on Cybersecurity emphasizes the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations on network information; there are no provisions to impede freedom of speech.\\n\\nIn fact, over the past time, a number of electronic newspapers have published articles about cases occurring in the province with content that falsely reflect facts, sensitive information, and have not been verified, but have spread to the public. The dizzying speed on social networks has greatly affected socio-economic activities and caused bad public opinion among the people.\\n\\nThe use of social networking sites also occurs many violations, typically a case related to a land dispute has posted clips on social networks, youtube with untrue content, and at the same time slandered. denounce, fabricate, exhort and incite to oppose the functional forces. After the clip was posted, there were hundreds of shares, likes and comments with bad content, smearing the government, especially including officials and employees of agencies in the province.\\n\\nA lot of false information like the above is spreading quickly because a part of people, especially young people, are only interested in sharing \"hot\" information to attract your attention. friends but rarely learn the true nature of that information. In addition, they do not understand the consequences of sharing false information, how harmful information will affect the security situation, politics, economy, society ... of the province.\\n\\nHowever, in the process of solving the above cases, there are still many difficulties in fighting and handling because the sanctions system is not enough deterrent, only handling from the perspective of education and reminders. or sanction administrative violations. Therefore, the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is extremely necessary, meeting the inevitable requirements of state management while still being consistent with the reality of social life; It is an important legal weapon to prevent and handle abuses and abuses, protect national security, and maintain social order and safety.\\n\\nTo prevent distortions and misunderstandings, distorting the meaning ofbenefits of the Cybersecurity Law, in order to avoid abuse and help better awareness and compliance with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, all levels, branches, the Fatherland Front and political organizations and unions - society, especially schools, information and communication agencies, press and publishing, need to strengthen propaganda and disseminate the content, meaning and role of the Law on Cybersecurity to a wide range of people. in many far-reaching ways to help officials, party members, union members, members, students, and people of all walks of life fully realize the importance and necessity of the Law on Cybersecurity, contribute to step by step bring the Law on Cybersecurity to life.\\n\\nThe advent of the internet and social networks has posed new challenges, humanity has to face a complex information system such as: Information difficult to verify, false information, malicious information about morality, lifestyle, and mental abuse against people. For individuals, the internet and social networks are tools that bad guys can use to spread false information in order to cheat to appropriate property, terrorize the spirit, threaten to post private information online. … For the state, the internet and social networks are powerful weapons that hostile forces and reactionaries at home and abroad have been, are and will be taking advantage of more and more thoroughly for propaganda and distorting activities in the future. , against the regime. After carrying out many activities to put pressure, but still could not prevent the National Assembly from passing the Law on Cybersecurity, especially when the Government announced to collect opinions on the Draft Decree on implementing the Law on Cybersecurity, the following positions could not be stopped. The more hostile and reactionary forces are, the more aggressively they use many tricks to create a wave of protests, obstruct the implementation and demand the abolition of this Law. They spread on social networks, claiming that the Law on Cybersecurity \"especially infringes on private space\", \"violats freedom of speech, press, internet\", \"violates human rights\". Many Western news agencies, newspapers and many websites with servers located abroad intentionally distort and obstruct the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law. A series of reactionary organizations and individuals at home and abroad have set up websites and blogs, and used many facebook accounts to mold and mix real and fake information, cut pictures, spread rumors, and attract attention. reader\\'s curiosity. In particular, during the time of important political events of the country, bad elements through facebook, zalo, youtube... posted and shared a lot of distorted information to lash out, satirize, cross sculpting events taking place throughout the country; smearing, fabricating, and discrediting the image of comrades leading the Party and State, leaders of agencies in the government system, causing skepticism among the people, and dividing the great national unity bloc. The hostile and reactionary forces have chosen social networks as a new \"front\", with full of cunning and sinister tricks to strengthen their resistance against our state. And it is reprehensible, when some people, because of ignorance, intentionally or unintentionally abet hostile and reactionary forces. It can be said that there has never been a time when hostile and reactionary forces had a methodical and detailed plan to distort and eliminate any law like the Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe negative reaction to the Cybersecurity Law of hostile forces, political opportunists, anti-regime and our State is also understandable, because for them, this is a legal tool. deprive them of important weapons that they can use to accomplish their goals of subverting, overthrowing, and transforming our regime into an alien \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" path. For the State and our people, the promulgation and strict implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity is one of the important guarantees and an effective measure to ensure human rights, legitimate rights and interests of citizens. help prevent and handle illegal acts in cyberspace, contributing to protecting national security and maintaining social order and safety. Therefore, each citizen needs to be alert, properly identify, to eliminate false, hostile and distorting views about the Cybersecurity Law, and ensure that the Law on Cybersecurity is effectively implemented. To do so, you must learn about the Law on Cybersecurity (maybe on Google) so that you do not violate or be taken advantage of by others to commit bad acts. In particular, do not abuse social networks to post, share, like, comment on websites, articles of unknown origin, false information that confuses public opinion and complicates the situation. In the case of detecting that someone has posted content that distorts, opposes the state, or spreads false rumors on social networks, people should immediately notify the agency, local government, police agency. where the incident occurred in order to take timely measures.\\n\\nEvery cadre, civil servant, public employee, student, student and the entire people should be aware of the plots and tricks to spread false and reactionary information of individuals and organizations that intend to oppose the law. Our Party and State so as not to be linked, provoked, or lured to participate in illegal activities. Every user of a social network must protect himself againstOn the flip side, recognize the duality of social networks, avoid inadvertently abetting anti-destructive activities, negative, objectionable behaviors, and uncultured behavior on social networks. In particular, people need to be very careful when accessing information posted from unofficial, fake, foreign-origin sites, or by reactionary individuals, elements, or organizations. There are activities against Vietnam established (some websites, facebook accounts of typical enemies and reactionaries such as: RFA - Radio Asia Tu D with address: www.rfa.org; BBC News Vietnamese – address: www.bbc.com, VOA Vietnamese – address: VOATiengViet.com, facebook.com/VOATiengViet, Youtobe.com/VOATiengVietVideo; Fanpage: Viet Tan, Catholic Youth, Good News for the Poor, Japan patriotic signing, Free Journalists Club, New Horizons Media, Brotherhood for Democracy, Hoang Sa FC, Page Portrait of Power, Quan make newspaper, facebook Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (ie Mother Mushroom), Hoang Ngoc Dieu, Le Cong Dinh, Nguyen Huy Vu,…). When accessing negative information on social networks, actively search for official press and information sites to compare and contrast. If the source, motive and purpose of the information and the person sharing the information cannot be identified, it is necessary to stay calm and careful not to comment or spread information. In addition, it is necessary to build a positive attitude to always seek and share good and useful information, limit reading negative, malicious and unknown information. Everyone needs to know how to take advantage and use social networks properly and effectively, turn social networks into a means and a useful channel to expand knowledge, together build a social network culture environment. a healthy society, avoid being influenced by virtual information, effectively contribute to the prevention and control of wrong and hostile thoughts and views.'\n",
      " '1. Actual situation of implementing the Law on Cybersecurity in Vietnam\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity, passed by the 5th session of the XIV National Assembly, consists of 7 Chapters and 43 Articles, stipulating the basic contents of cybersecurity protection for information systems important to national security; prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security, implement cybersecurity protection activities and prescribe responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals. The provisions of the Cybersecurity Law 2018 focus on preventing, detecting, fighting and handling illegal acts in cyberspace, infringing upon objects that must be protected as security. country, social order and safety.\\n\\nSince its promulgation and implementation, the Law on Cybersecurity has shown the effectiveness of legal institutions for activities in cyberspace. The reality of the past year has refuted some fabricated information such as the Law on Cybersecurity preventing and infringing on the right to freedom of expression. Evidence shows that the Law on Cybersecurity does not prevent or infringe on citizens\\' freedom of expression. Communication, exchange, posting, information sharing, purchase and sale, business and commerce activities still take place normally in cyberspace, without being prevented or prohibited as long as such activities are not violate the laws of Vietnam. Citizens can do anything in cyberspace that is not prohibited by Vietnamese law. The Law on Cybersecurity protects free speech activities, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals when buying, selling, doing business, exchanging and trading in cyberspace. Any unverified, untrue information that adversely affects social order and safety will be handled resolutely and promptly (1). Typically, the handling of those who spread false information about the Covid-19 epidemic has been dealt with drastically and seriously by localities. The authorities not only tracked down and dealt with those who spread fake news, but also asked social networking sites to remove fake news and publish official information from competent authorities. Put an end to information disturbance, panic and anxiety among people in the early days of the outbreak, affecting epidemic prevention and control.\\n\\nIn fact, there have been many bad guys who spread the news that the Law on Cybersecurity prohibits internet users from accessing Facebook, Google, and Youtube. However, since the application of the Law, people using the internet can still easily access all websites at home and abroad. The Law on Cybersecurity stipulates measures to protect network security for people when participating in activities on social networking sites such as Facebook, Google... But if any individual or organization uses cyberspace to committing acts of violating the law will be strictly handled according to the provisions of law.\\n\\nWhile the Law has no regulations on controlling, managing, limiting or hindering business activities of enterprises, as well as start-up activities. However, many bad guys have spread the news that the Law on Cybersecurity has hindered Vietnamese telecommunications, internet and start-up businesses. Recently, the Law on Cybersecurity has proven that no online service provider has stopped operating. All business activities as long as they do not violate the law will still take place normally on the network environment. The law only stipulates the cooperative responsibility of enterprises in protecting national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals in cyberspace; guide businesses, organizations and individuals to apply measures to protect themselves against threats from cyberspace.\\n\\nTherefore, each subject using cyberspace needs to be aware of the posted information and consciously comply with the law for the peaceful development of the country; well aware of the implementation of the law on cyber security, contributing to protecting the ideological foundation of the Party, fighting against wrong and hostile views in the new situation in accordance with the spirit of Resolution 35-NQ/TW of the Politburo.\\n\\nThe current situation of implementing the law on cybersecurity in Vietnam is reflected in the following four aspects:\\n\\nFirst, comply with the law on cybersecurity: Implementing the Party and State\\'s guidelines and policies on cybersecurity, Vietnam has promulgated the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity. The situation of cyber security control is increasing. get into order. It shows that the determination to implement is there, but with the official legal tool in hand, everything becomes easier and more convenient. However, along with the initial achievements, cyber security is facing many risks with the law violations of increasingly sophisticated actors. According to the annual report on the security situation of the Ministry of Public Security, in 2018, fraudulent activities to appropriate property on social networks (Facebook, Zalo, Viber, WhatsApp...) were complicated, emerging as the state of fraudulent appropriation of property by texting to announce winning via social networks; get to know the victim, create trust, promise to send money or valuable gifts, then impersonate a customs officer to ask the victim to transfer moneycustoms clearance procedures for appropriation. Business activities under the multi-level model via the internet are still complicated with many new and sophisticated methods and tricks such as: Setting up a website to organize capital mobilization to pay high interest rates to appropriate assets; taking advantage of charitable activities to defraud and appropriate property; established and created many exchanges of cryptocurrencies operating under a multi-level model such as: Onecoin, Bitcoin, ILcoin, Gemcoin... to attract investors to appropriate assets or trade in cryptocurrencies. Illegal to launder money, ship goods, pay football bets. Typically, Nguyen Huu Tien and his accomplices set up the website Otcmax.vn to advertise project investment with a high profit of 1.8%/day and invest in virtual currency VNCoins with a profit of 2.5%/day, has appropriated more than 200 billion VND from 6,000 people; Sky Mining virtual currency mining cooperative with the advertising trick of being the \"largest virtual money mining company in Vietnam\" calls on investors to buy virtual currency mining machines with the promise of returning capital and interest after 12 months. % of investment, has appropriated over 300 billion VND from investors. In addition, the situation of gambling and betting on football on the internet is very complicated, with the amount of money gambling up to trillions of dong. Foreign bookmakers often connect with domestic ones to form a large network of gambling organizations for both Vietnamese and foreigners (2). For profit purposes, many organizations and individuals doing business on the Internet have not complied with the legal provisions on network security. The problem of online advertising goods on one side, but when the delivery is not of the right quality, not on time as promised, tends to increase.\\n\\nSecond, enforcement of the law on network security: Determining that the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law is one of the key tasks, determining the success of law enforcement on network security, dated 1-2-- In 2019, the Prime Minister issued Decision No. 12/QD-TTg promulgating the Plan to implement the Law on Cybersecurity, which directed the organization of conferences to thoroughly understand and disseminate to ministries and agencies. capacity, People\\'s Committees of provinces and centrally-run cities, the subjects of impact of the Law on Cybersecurity so that people know, understand and strictly implement it. Agencies, organizations and individuals assigned the task of implementing the law on cyber security have deployed and organized the implementation of assigned tasks to ensure compliance with regulations and ensure that the law on cyber security is implemented. exam. In addition to approaching cyberspace as a new territory that needs to be protected, accessing cyberspace in terms of technical and tangible characteristics, cyberspace is considered as a computer system that needs to be protected. guard. In this sense, law enforcement on network security is understood as mandatory application of security measures to identified network components including equipment, databases, and infrastructure. It is imperative that the physical resources of the network be used in accordance with regulations.\\n\\nThird, the use of the law on network security: The law on cyber security stipulates that legal subjects have the right to use subject rights to protect their legitimate rights and interests in the field of network security. . Agencies, organizations and individuals are active and proactive in using the law to exercise and protect lawful rights and interests because competent entities have ensured the implementation of legal provisions. about network security. Accordingly, Articles 5, 6, 8, 9 Chapter I of the Law on Cybersecurity stipulate that organizations and individuals have the authority to use the law on cyber security in applying measures to protect network security such as: network security assessment; assess network security conditions; network security check; network security monitoring; responding to and overcoming network security incidents; fight to protect network security; use cryptography to protect network information; prevent, request to suspend or stop providing network information; suspend, temporarily suspend activities of establishing, providing and using telecommunications networks, the internet, manufacturing and using radio transmitters and receivers in accordance with law; request the deletion, access and deletion of illegal or untrue information in cyberspace infringing upon national security, social order and safety, lawful rights and interests of agencies and organizations organizations and individuals; collect electronic data related to activities infringing upon national security, social order and safety, and lawful rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals in cyberspace; blockade and limit the operation of the information system; suspend, temporarily suspend or request to stop the operation of the information system, revoke the domain name in accordance with the law; prosecute, investigate, prosecute and adjudicate according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code; other measures in accordance with the law on national security, the law on handling of administrative violations...\\n\\nChapter II of the Law on Cybersecurity also stipulates network security protection activities for information systems important for national security, such as: Protection of information systems important for national security, including: important information system on national security; protect network securityfor information systems important to national security; network security assessment for information systems important for national security; examine and evaluate network security for information systems important to national security; monitor, warn, respond to and remedy network security incidents occurring to information systems important to national security...\\n\\nFourth, apply the law on network security: The responsibility to protect network security is carried out by many agencies and organizations, of which the focal point for state management of cybersecurity is clearly defined in the Law on Cybersecurity. . Supervision, inspection and handling of violations of the law by state agencies with the function of network security protection is an important form of law application. The Ministry of Public Security has had many active activities in detecting, investigating and handling violations of the law on cyber security. In the spirit of resolutely minimizing risks and challenges from cyber security, ensuring that activities in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests. of agencies, organizations and individuals, in 2019, the Ministry of Public Security has strengthened measures to clarify new methods and tricks of criminals using high technology in card payment and electricity payment activities. death; dismantled many criminal lines of gambling and betting on football via the internet such as: the arrest of 10 people in a gambling line, organizing an online gambling with an amount of about 500 billion dong in Hanoi; the arrest of 29 people gambling over the internet with an amount of over 1,000 billion VND in Hung Yen; the arrest of 13 internet gamblers with the amount of 12 billion dong, identified that there are about 100 accounts in 33 provinces and cities nationwide participating in gambling in Nghe An; foreign criminals using high technology in Vietnam. Investigate and arrest many subjects who set up many websites, facebook, virtual zalo, scam billions of dong. Detected 352 cases, 503 criminals and violated the law in the field of telecommunications and informatics (up 17.73% of cases compared to the same period in 2018). Prosecuted 164 cases, 304 accused (an increase of 17.99% of cases and an increase of 6.29% of defendants compared to the same period in 2018)(3). In early February, the Quang Nam Provincial Police force successfully dismantled an online gambling line in the form of football betting and lotteries with an amount of more than 40 billion VND (4).\\n\\nIn the form of law application of state agencies on cybersecurity, the court\\'s adjudication of cases of violation of the cybersecurity law has a particularly important role and influence. , because only the Court has the judicial function. Before accepting the file, the Court may apply temporary urgent measures to protect the interests of the litigants. During the trial, the court strictly followed the strict order and procedures of the Criminal Procedure Law. Sanctions applied to violators are deterrent and educational. However, the actual trial of the court industry in recent years shows that there are not many criminal cases in this field.\\n\\nSome limitations in the implementation of the law on cybersecurity above stem from many inadequate legal provisions on network security. Therefore, many subjects are still confused when applying it to real life. The awareness of compliance with the law on cybersecurity of most organizations and individuals is not high; Human resources specialized in cybersecurity protection are limited in terms of qualifications and capacity and have not met the requirements in the new situation. The infrastructure equipment has not yet been mastered, and technology products must be imported from abroad, mostly from China.\\n\\n2. Some solutions to improve the effectiveness of the implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity in Vietnam in the coming time\\n\\nIn order to promote the positive impact of the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity, overcome limitations and inadequacies in the implementation of the law on cybersecurity, and contribute to improving the effectiveness of the implementation of the law on cybersecurity. In the future, the following solutions should be implemented synchronously:\\n\\nFirstly, thoroughly grasp the leadership of the Party, the unified management of the State; mobilize the synergy of the political system and the entire people; promote the core role of the specialized force for cybersecurity protection under the Ministry of Public Security assigned by the Government to be the focal point for state management of cyber security.\\n\\nStrengthen the leadership of the Party in building and perfecting the law on cyber security as a basis for the implementation of the law on cyber security. The law on cybersecurity has contributed to building a unified awareness for the subjects, adjusting the behavior of law enforcement in a more and more positive direction. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly improve the legal system on network security.\\n\\nIt is necessary to study and eliminate regulations that cause overlapping interpretations between the 2015 Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity and the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity. Supplement missing regulations to meet the requirements of regulating social relations. continuously arise in the context of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. In addition, it is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of inconsistency between provisions in legal documents.\\n\\nSecond, continue to review, develop and complete the legal provisions on prevention of cancerpublish and operate the network security system in accordance with international standards; perfecting the legal institution on the implementation of the law in general and the law on cyber security in particular in order to meet the requirements of national cyber security protection.\\n\\nTo step up the propaganda and dissemination of the law on network security. The authorities will soon research and innovate methods, forms and contents of activities so that people can understand and properly understand the law on cyber security. Comply with the law on network security; ensure the interests of the State, the lawful rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals when operating in the network environment.\\n\\nThird, supplementing sanctions in the law on cyber security in the direction that it must be enough to deter and prevent violations; clearly stipulate a coordination mechanism between state management agencies in charge of cybersecurity, ensuring that all violations of the law on cyber security must be handled promptly and strictly. The sanctions applied must be enough to deter and educate in order to prevent and stop violations.\\n\\nFourth, strengthen international cooperation and promote technology transfer. Implementing the law on cybersecurity in Vietnam is a new activity. The first legal document regulating social relations in the field of cybersecurity was issued by the State in 1997, which was the Prime Minister\\'s Decree No. 21/ND-CP dated March 5, 1997 on promulgating the Provisional Regulation on the management, establishment and use of the internet network in Vietnam, and at the same time issuing the Decision on the establishment of the National Internet Coordinating Committee. This is an important Decree defining responsibilities for state management, provision and use of internet services. Meanwhile, many countries around the world have a long history of cybersecurity protection. The implementation of cybersecurity legislation in these countries is really experienced for Vietnam to refer to and apply, such as the US, Russia, Singapore, etc.\\n\\nPromote international cooperation in order to transfer experiences suitable to Vietnam\\'s practice, thereby raising the awareness of law compliance of entities when participating in cyberspace activities. At the same time, resolutely apply strong measures to handle illegal acts in cyberspace, take advantage of the media in the context of Technology 4.0 to promptly publicize cases. Infringement of the network security law has been handled.\\n\\nFifth, state agencies, organizations and enterprises need to implement solutions to ensure overall network safety and security in order to overcome the above shortcomings and limitations, contributing to further improving the ranking. of Vietnam in the GCI. Thoroughly grasping the principle that Ministers, Heads of ministerial-level agencies, Governmental agencies, Presidents of People\\'s Committees of provinces and centrally run cities, Presidents and General Directors of State corporations and corporations , the State Commercial Bank, the Vietnam Development Bank, the Bank for Social Policies, the Cooperative Bank of Vietnam and other state credit and financial institutions are responsible to the Prime Minister if in order to cause unsafety, cyber security, or disclosure of state secrets at the agency or unit under their management. Designate and strengthen the focal point of a unit in charge of network information security to do a good job of advising, organizing the implementation, inspecting and urging the implementation of legal provisions on assurance of safety and security. network security. To closely coordinate with the specialized agency in charge of network safety and security of the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of National Defense in monitoring, sharing information, inspecting and assessing safety and security. network.\\n\\nFor monitoring and responding to network information security incidents, protecting information systems under their management: Self-monitoring and responding to network information security incidents, protecting information systems under the management or selection of organizations or enterprises with sufficient capacity to perform; notify information on the focal point for monitoring and responding to cyberinformation security incidents to the Ministry of Information and Communications and when there is a change in focal information; connecting and sharing information with the National Cybersecurity Monitoring Center under the Information Security Department, Ministry of Information and Communications.\\n\\nFor the inspection and assessment of network information security for information systems under their management, it is necessary to select an organization or enterprise that is independent of the monitoring and protection organization or enterprise for periodic inspection. assess network information security for level 3 or higher information systems under their management, or irregularly inspect and evaluate when required in accordance with law. For level 3 and level 4 information systems, annually inspect, evaluate and report to the Ministry of Information and Communications and the Prime Minister. For the national important information system (level 5), every 6 months, check, evaluate and report to the Ministry of Information and Communications to summarize and report to the Prime Minister.\\n\\nPrioritize the use of products, solutions and services of domestic enterprises that meet the requirements of network safety and security as prescribed by law for level 3 information systems.and above, information systems serving e-Government. Ensure that the proportion of expenditures for network information security products and services reaches at least 10% of the total budget for implementing the annual, 5-year information technology application plan and public projects. information technology (in case the investor does not have a technical system or hires a specialized network information security assurance service that meets the provisions of the law on assurance of information system security at different levels). ). Using and managing the secret key (USB token) of digital signatures, Government specialized digital signature authentication services, digital certificates, encryption solutions of the Government Cipher Board in accordance with regulations. Continue to improve mechanisms, policies and legal frameworks on cyberinformation security, cyber security, cybercrime, and child protection in the cyber environment; strategies, master plans and plans on development of network information security; develop human resources for safety and network security; standards and technical regulations on network information security. Timely provide information and data on legal, technical, organizational, capacity building and cooperation in the field of network safety and security to serve the assessment and ranking of ITU\\'s GCI index(5 )'\n",

      " 'The Law on Cybersecurity has provisions to protect people from bad and malicious information by requiring domestic and foreign businesses to provide services on telecommunications networks, the internet and aerial value-added services. Cyberspace in Vietnam is responsible for eliminating sources of bad information by not or stopping providing services to these subjects. The law was passed by the National Assembly at its 5th session, and took effect on January 1, 2019.\\n\\nIn recent years, there have been more and more law violations in cyberspace, causing frustration in society. These are activities that take advantage of cyberspace to infringe upon national security, social order and safety. , propagate, distort, slander, and oppose the state. In addition, there are cyber espionage activities, stealing state secrets, infringing on economic management order and social order and safety, which emerge as activities of fraud, theft, gambling, and fishing. violence, online prostitution, theft of personal information, slander, humiliation of others and above all cyber attacks, hijacking, cyber terrorism, cyber war.\\n\\nHowever, the handling of these cases is very passive, embarrassing and ineffective because there is no legal corridor that fully, specifically, and clearly regulates violations of the law in space. There are no strict and strong sanctions to effectively handle violations of national security, social order and safety, and violations of legitimate rights and interests of organizations. , individuals in cyberspace.\\n\\nAccording to a report by the Vietnam Computer Emergency Response Center (VNCERT) under the Ministry of Information and Communications, in 2017, information systems in Vietnam suffered about 15,000 cyber attacks, including about 3,000 phishing attacks (Phishing), 6,500 malware attacks (Malware) and 4,500 interface changing attacks (Deface).\\n\\nIn particular, the number of attacks on the information systems of state agencies with the domain name \".gov.vn\" also reached hundreds. In the first 5 months of 2018, 4,035 incidents of cyberattacks were recorded in Vietnam, in February and March alone, there were more than 1,500 cyberattacks. Insecurity vulnerabilities are increasing, about more than 300% per year, causing the risk of network information security to increase rapidly when entering the Industrial Revolution 4.0.\\n\\nAccording to cybersecurity experts, even when the Law on Cyberinformation Security was promulgated (2015), there was no legal document regulating information systems important to national security, these systems not adequately protected. Therefore, the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is very necessary, appropriate, and meets the urgent requirements of the current practical situation.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity consists of 7 chapters and 43 articles that stipulate the basic contents of cybersecurity protection for information systems important for national security; prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security; deploying network security protection activities and stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\nIn order to maximally protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals in cyberspace, the Law stipulates full measures to prevent, fight and handle in order to eliminate threats, detect and detect threats. and handle violations of the law, including prevention and handling of online information containing propaganda content against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; inciting riots, disrupting security and disrupting public order; humiliate, slander; infringing upon the economic management order; prevention and combat of cyber espionage, protection of state secret information, work secrets, and personal information online;...\\n\\n\"This is a solid legal corridor for people to be able to do business or operate in cyberspace with peace of mind,\" he said. Currently, user data in Vietnam online has been widely used, for profit purposes, but the state does not have enough legal corridor to manage. Even the data has been used for political conspiracies or in violation of the law. Therefore, in order to strictly manage and protect Vietnam\\'s data online, the Law stipulates that domestic and foreign enterprises providing services in cyberspace have activities of collecting, exploiting, analyzing, processing personal data, data about the relationship of service users, data created by service users in Vietnam must store this data in Vietnam.\\n\\nIn fact, Vietnamese people are increasingly dependent on foreign social networks. This is a global issue that many countries are concerned about, not only Vietnam. Meanwhile, many Vietnamese information technology enterprises have ambitions to build a social network to compete with Facebook or a competitive search engine Google, but due to their limited financial potential, they face many obstacles.\\nDesigning and building their own social network is a policy that big countries like Russia and China are implementing. Accordingly, the Governments of Russia and China have taken a number of measures to prevent and limit the use of social networks from abroad, and at the same time encourage and create maximum conditions for citizens to use social networks operated by businesses. provided by domestic industry. VietnameseSouth is a country that currently has 50.1 million internet users and this number continues to grow. Limitations when people depend on foreign social networks, the state of leaking state secrets, destructive activities of elements, hostile forces as well as the degree of tax evasion and lack of cooperation of agencies. A global technology corporation pushes us to build Vietnam\\'s social network. In order for Vietnamese businesses to develop a globally competitive social network, policies must be synchronized, prioritizing tax and fee reduction, and developing digital content to form a strong digital ecosystem. This work requires the cooperation of four companies: a telecommunications infrastructure provider - a social network operator - an advertiser and a content developer in the country to hope to build a digital ecosystem in Vietnam.\\n\\nAccording to online newspaper VTV.vn, Vietnam\\'s Zalo social network has just celebrated its 10th anniversary and now has more than 80 million users worldwide. Compared to the \"empire\" Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, it is clear that Zalo is still a small social network. But the initial success of Zalo, as well as the success of Viettel when investing abroad are signals that our information technology businesses can completely step into the big sea successfully.\\n\\nIt is also a signal for each Vietnamese citizen to confidently build an \"online people\\'s war posture\" - an issue of vital significance to preserve the Vietnamese national cultural identity in the Revolutionary era.

Therefore, bad actors have taken advantage of it to propagate, incite protests, and oppose the Law on Cybersecurity in order to steer public opinion in an unfavorable direction with the aim of obstructing or causing panic and suspicion in the law. the masses to the Party and State\\'s policies on cyber security.\\n\\n\\n2. Under the provisions of the Law on Cybersecurity, individuals are entitled to the following benefits:\\n\\n\\n(1) Be protected when participating in cyberspace activities against bad, malicious information, infringing upon honor, reputation, dignity, cyberattacks, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism or other acts that affect their lawful rights and interests. With the scope of regulation of the Cybersecurity Law, organizations and individuals operating in a national cyber environment will be guaranteed to be safer and healthier than before, minimizing factors and risks. opportunities to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals such as: personal information theft, fraud, appropriation of property, slander, humiliation, defamation, restriction of malicious code , gradually eliminate gambling, betting, transmission of depraved cultural products inciting violence, prostitution and other illegal acts in cyberspace; strictly protect personal data in cyberspace; children are protected in cyberspace…; ensure an equal business environment between domestic enterprises and foreign enterprises in terms of management, compatibility with the provisions of law and responsibilities and obligations to be performed.\\n\\n\\n(2) To participate in and inherit the State\\'s cybersecurity policies such as: research and development of network security; improve self-control capacity in network security; network security education and training.\\n\\n\\n(3) Being given tools to protect their interests:\\n\\n\\n- Article 16 of the Law on Cybersecurity provides for the prevention and handling of illegal information in cyberspace, clearly stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals in detecting, preventing and removing information that violates the law, as well as request the specialized network security force to take measures to protect network security to remove information that violates the law. This means that people have clearer tools to protect themselves when bad information infringes upon their legitimate rights and interests.\\n\\n\\n- Article 17 of the Cybersecurity Law will help protect people against cyber espionage activities, protect personal secrets, family secrets and private life in cyberspace.- Article 18 of the Cybersecurity Law helps protect people from cybercriminal activities, such as appropriating property, stealing credit card information, bank accounts, etc.\\n\\n\\n- Article 19 of the Law on Cybersecurity gives tools to protect people from cyberattacks, such as spreading malicious code, denial of service attacks, etc.\\n\\n\\n- Article 26, Law on Cybersecurity \"reinforces\" more tools to protect people from malicious information by requiring domestic and foreign businesses when providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and Additional services on cyberspace in Vietnam are responsible for eliminating sources of bad information by not or stopping providing services to these people. At the same time, it helps to protect people\\'s personal information, personal secrets, and avoid being collected and abused (in case personal data of Facebook users is abused for political activities). By requiring some foreign businesses to set up branches and representative offices, that is, having a legal entity in Vietnam will help people have the right to manage, use and complain about their data.\\n\\n\\n(4) Children with special protection in cyberspace: Article 29 of the Law on Cybersecurity prescribes the contents of protecting children in cyberspace. In which, it requires information system owners, enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace, agencies, organizations, parents, teachers, caregivers. caregivers and other individuals responsible for protecting children when children participate in cyberspace; requesting the specialized cyber security force to apply necessary measures to protect children\\'s rights in cyberspace.\\n\\n\\n(5) To be protected by a specialized force for cybersecurity protection when participating in activities in cyberspace, when the task force is empowered to take necessary cybersecurity protection measures (Article 5), helping this force operate more effectively and efficiently, which means it will protect national security, social order and safety, and the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\n\\n(6) The rights of individuals will be guaranteed when all people are equal before the law. All illegal acts in cyberspace will be handled in accordance with the law. Community responsibility for cybersecurity will be enhanced, when agencies, organizations and enterprises in information system management and service provision in cyberspace are identified with specific responsibilities, contributing to important for the formation of a safe and healthy cyberspace.\\n\\n\\n3. The Law on Cybersecurity does not control all of citizens\\' personal information.\\n\\n\\nIn the face of serious and complicated illegal activities in cyberspace, it is necessary to ensure the basis and conditions for quick and effective investigation and handling of the law enforcement force. necessary and urgent, including the responsibilities of domestic and foreign service providers. Information of individuals with illegal activities is one of the important types of data for law enforcement forces to investigate and handle violations of the law.\\n\\n\\nPoint a, Clause 2, Article 26 of the draft Law on Cybersecurity stipulates: “Domestic and foreign enterprises, when providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam, have the responsibility to: responsible for providing user information to the specialized cyber security force under the Ministry of Public Security upon written request to serve the investigation and handling of violations of the law on cyber security.\\n\\n\\nThus, the network security protection force is only allowed to access personal information of users with illegal activities, with strict order and procedures (in writing), approved by the relevant authorities. authorized to approve. Currently, there is a lot of information on the cyberspace that the Law on Cybersecurity requires businesses to provide all user information such as personal information, private information to the authorities is incorrect. .\\n\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity clearly stipulates that only in the case of investigation and handling of violations of the law on network security, the network security protection force has the right to request information. user.\\n\\n\\nThe provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and related documents clearly stipulate the management and use of information provided to serve the investigation and handling of law violations.\\n\\n\\n4. The Law on Cybersecurity does not hinder the operation of enterprises, does not create sub-licenses.\\n\\n\\nOf the 7 regulations related to the responsibilities of enterprises providing services in cyberspace in the Law on Cybersecurity, none of them are related to business activities of enterprises, nor are there any regulations requiring enterprises to provide services in cyberspace. requires businesses providing services in cyberspace to have a sub-license to be allowed to operate.\\n\\n\\nExcept for coordinating with the network security protection force to handle illegal acts in cyberspace and a number of responsibilities as specified in Governing Body.Article 41 is related to warning, remedying and handling violations of the law, enterprises do not have to fulfill any other obligations for their business activities. There is no provision on cybersecurity in the Law on Cybersecurity that regulates enterprise establishment, start-up, investment, purchase, sale and business activities.'\n",

In Ho Chi Minh City, over the past time, many social network users have shown signs of violating the Cybersecurity Law, such as the case of spreading and sharing \"hot\" clips of singer Van Mai Huong. How to let people know if sharing, spreading this content online is against the law and will be handled.\\n\\nOn the forums, many opinions said that, in the past, many individuals spoke out against the Law on Cybersecurity. However, many cases have to resort to law enforcement agencies, need the Law on Cybersecurity to be protected, like the case of singer Van Mai Huong. This proves that the Law on Cybersecurity is very necessary, so that whenever there are cases like this, there will be tools to deal with violators, or to prevent similar incidents from happening.\\n\\nRecently, the Department of Information and Communications (TT & TT) of Ho Chi Minh City. Ho Chi Minh invited famous artists such as Dam Vinh Hung, Cat Phuong, Ngo Thanh Van ... to work because of spreading false information about the Covid-19 epidemic situation on social networks, causing confusion.

The Ministry of Public Security has directed police units and localities to fight and handle according to law provisions. Up to now, the authorities have summoned the subjects, forced the removal of false information, committed not to repeat the offense. At the same time, based on the law to punish serious cases. If, after being administratively handled for spreading fake news, they re-offend and have sufficient grounds, they will be criminally prosecuted.\\n\\nOn February 3, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc signed Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP stipulating penalties for administrative violations in the fields of post, telecommunications, radio frequencies, information technology and Electronic transactions (effective from April 15) are considered to have clearer, stronger regulations and heavier penalties than the previous Decree No. 174/2013/ND-CP. This decree, when combined with the Law on Cybersecurity, which has been in effect since the past 13 months, is expected to \"match the two swords\" against ugly and harmful acts in the public cyberspace.\\n\\nSpecifically, Article 101: Violations against regulations on responsibility for using social networking services.

      " 'It probably doesn\\'t need to be said much, but all people know that they have been using the telecommunications network for obscure and illegal activities, so they are afraid and boycott the Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity (ANM). Who are they?\\n\\nThey are drug dealers, prostitutes, smugglers through telecommunications networks. They are anonymous people on telecommunications networks to distort, oppose, and defame the reputation and dignity of other people and social organizations that they hate, distort, defame, discredit and oppose. Party and State of Socialist Vietnam. They use telecommunications networks to connect, collude with each other to terrorize the peaceful life of others or social organizations. They use the telecommunications network to connect and collude with reactionary and hostile forces at home and abroad to plot against and overthrow the people\\'s government, plot against and overthrow the Socialist State of Vietnam. socialist. They use the telecommunications network to connect, to collude embezzlement, corrupt the country and harm the people, etc., and so on.\\nThe entire Vietnamese people, please stay awake to see the true face of these evil people without believing in the things that the wicked and liars have propagated, misrepresented, provoked and completely fabricated. .\\nCurrently, Vietnam is always in the group of 10 countries with the most cyberattacks in the world, fast-growing crime, information disorder in cyberspace, disinformation, libel, slander, etc. Infringement of dignity, violations of fine customs and traditions are rampant..., the national cyber infrastructure has many gaps and weaknesses. Typically, some reactionary elements have tried to use social networks to promote, incite and incite social riots, overthrow the government in the form of demonstrations in recent days. That\\'s why they keep trying to oppose the ANM Law.\\n\\nThe ANM Law stipulates a lot of things, just to make it short and easy to understand: The law was born to help us have a legal basis to protect national sovereignty, security, user data and prevent illegal acts. violate the law such as cyberattack, espionage, terrorism, anti-state, theft, misrepresentation, fraud, incitement, etc. Thus, the birth of the law will not only help ensure sovereignty and security. national security on the internet, but also to clean up and bring about the safety of people\\'s information.\\n\\nAlthough the ANM Law brings many benefits, surfing through social networks, most people only care about Facebook and Google will leave Vietnam or some people often \"eat the waves, talk the wind\" that this is how the government silences the people, going against the 4.0 trend of the world.\\n\\nIn fact, since July 2017, Google and Facebook have set up thousands of servers in Vietnam, associated with enterprises with large network infrastructure such as Viettel, VNPT, FPT. Not only that, Facebook and Google are also free to rent server space. The servers host the information system related to the needs of Vietnamese people, helping Vietnamese customers to use Google services 2 times faster than usual because they do not have to make international connections. With a large population, the potential to develop advertising services is great, even if the law is stricter, Facebook and Google will never leave this lucrative piece of cake. Not only Vietnam, 18 countries that are members of WTO such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Denmark, Finland, Russia, Indonesia, China ... all have regulations to store data in the territory. country and the other two giants had to accept the rules of the game when they wanted to do business and make money from other countries.\\n\\nThe law was born to protect people\\'s interests in cyberspace. Those who cry out for the law to silence, lose freedom and democracy are the ones who only do wrong things and violate Vietnamese law, so they are so afraid to face this law. The law clearly stipulates that only when there is a crime or investigation of illegal activities, the authorities will require the enterprise to provide information related to the subject of that crime. Therefore, if we are dignified, strictly obey the law, authorities will never control our information on the internet.\\n\\nNot only Vietnam has the ANM Law, in Germany, when logging into Facebook, in addition to agreeing to Facebook\\'s terms, you must also agree to comply with the German Cybersecurity Law specializing in social networks, abbreviated as NETzDG, in which stipulates sanctions for the crimes of Conspiring to use violence to subvert national security, Instructing others to use violence to threaten national security, forging information to affect foreign security, into criminal and terrorist organizations at home and abroad; collection of these organizations, Crime of instigating (violence, hatred), Crime of insulting beliefs, religion, Distribution, acquisition and possession of pornography…. EVERYTHING IS BANNED. Thus, Germany\\'s cybersecurity law has many similarities with Vietnam\\'s law. And we also see, Germany is still developing, human rights are still guaranteed, still integrated, there is no setback in terms of political economy.\\n\\nLike in real life, the Internet is a society, although it is virtual, it has a profound impactIt extends to real life and therefore legal regulations to ensure internet safety is an essential need. The obvious lessons from using the internet to entice people to incite sabotage, which are still hot, are proof of the need for this law. Convinced that, with the Cybersecurity Law, our country will become more peaceful and safer so that we can fully focus on economic development, building this country into a place worth living. as we have always expected./'\n",
      " 'Today\\'s cyberspace becomes a new social space where people can perform acts of communication, creativity, labor, production, consumption, learning and entertainment, without restrictions. limited by space and time. However, along with great benefits, cyberspace is creating risks and challenges for national security, human security and social order and safety. Enemy forces take advantage of the Internet and social networks to distort the Party\\'s platform, lines, viewpoints and ideological foundation; enticing and inciting disgruntled elements, gathering forces, and establishing opposing organizations; spreading documents, calling for marches and demonstrations, causing instability in political security, social order and safety. Right after the Law on Cybersecurity of our country was promulgated, it was also distorted, opposed and denied by some organizations and individuals who lacked goodwill.\\n\\nNot only that, cyberspace can also be exploited to cause damage to property, spirit, health, and even human life. In the past time, there have been many online scams, people posting comments, comments, sharing, even making up false stories and clips that adversely affect their health and reputation. reputation and prestige of other organizations and individuals. From the above issues, it can be seen that protecting network security is more important than ever, this is not only the responsibility of the State and functional agencies, but also the obligations and responsibilities of each individual. citizen. Therefore, in order to build a \"healthy cyberspace\", in my opinion, every citizen needs to do the following things well:\\n\\nFirstly, each individual needs to study and understand clearly the meaning, values, contents of the Cybersecurity Law, rights, obligations, responsibilities and prohibited acts when participating in cyberspace activities.\\n\\nAccordingly, the Law on Cybersecurity aims to protect legitimate users in cyberspace; prevent, fight, and frustrate activities of using cyberspace to infringe upon national security, oppose the State, propagate and destroy ideology, sabotage internal affairs, incite protests and disrupt forces of various powers. reactionary. Preventing, stopping, responding to and overcoming the consequences of cyber attacks and cyber-terrorism and preventing and combating the risk of cyberwar.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity clearly stipulates prohibited acts such as: using cyberspace to propagate against the State; organizing, operating, colluding, instigating, bribing, deceiving, enticing, training and training people against the State; distorting history...). These regulations do not infringe on human rights, do not hinder freedom of expression, do not create barriers, do not hinder the normal and lawful activities of organizations and individuals such as information on social networks. , blogs, reactionary websites that propagate and distort in recent times. Complying with the Law means protecting yourself, relatives and family, and at the same time, contributing to the protection of national cybersecurity.\\n\\nSecond, self-cultivate skills to identify conspiracies and tricks that pose a risk of network insecurity, especially plots and tricks of \"peaceful evolution\", riots and subversion of hostile forces. Identifying opposition organizations operating in cyberspace such as Viet Tan, the Provisional National Government of Vietnam...; tricks to create a cover for \"civil society\", \"democracy forum\",... to fight back; Fake websites, websites with a lot of bad and toxic information.\\n\\nEveryone needs to know the tricks of cyber attacks such as knocking down websites; install it on a personal computer or get an account and password; stealing personal data (photos, videos); malicious code attacks (according to email attachments or hidden in Skype ads); anonymous attacks with malicious software (antivirus software, browsers); attack via USB, CD…\\n\\nThird, Raise awareness of prevention and self-defense when participating in social networks. Research carefully before liking or sharing files, posts or links; beware of strange websites (dark web), unknown E-mails and suspicious links; absolutely do not be dua, curious, or greedy for money along with the words of incitement and instigation of bad objects. Timely provide information, comply with requests and instructions of competent state agencies and responsible persons.\\n\\nMake good use of technical measures to ensure information security such as creating a habit of scanning for viruses; perform backups on an external hard drive, on a local network, or on cloud storage services; check the leakage of personal account information through the Vietnam Cyber \\u200b\\u200bAttack Handling Center. When a network attack is detected, quickly disconnect from the network; use malicious decryption tools; notify the person in charge via the hotline.\\n\\nFourth, it is necessary to know how to make use of and use social networks properly and effectively, turning social networks into a means and a useful channel to expand knowledge and build a network culture environment together. a healthy society, avoid being influenced by virtual information, effectively contribute to the prevention and control of wrong and hostile thoughts and views.\\n\\nFifth, Popularize, propagate in the familyfamily, relatives, friends and people living in the place of residence shall comply with the provisions of the Law on Cybersecurity so that everyone can grasp, understand and not commit acts of violation related to cyber security, contributing to building a \"space healthy network from the ground up”.\\n\\nWith its borderless nature, cyberspace has a global reach and impacts the whole world. The risks from cyberspace increase in proportion to the development and application of information technology in social life. Therefore, ensuring network security requires a total solution, from the promulgation and enforcement of policies and laws by state management agencies, creativity, autonomy in production, provision of products and services in cyberspace ensure the network safety and security of enterprises to the sense of participation in building a safe and healthy cyberspace of every citizen.'\n",
      " '1. Cyberspace and its impacts on security and order\\n\\nIn the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity, the concept of cyberspace is introduced. Accordingly, “Cyberspace is the connecting network of information technology infrastructure, including telecommunications network, Internet, computer network, information system, information processing and control system, database; is a place where people perform social behaviors that are not limited by space and time”.(1)[1]\\n\\nThus, Cyberspace is a broader concept than the Internet. It is the globally interconnected network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and processing and control systems in key industries, is a special environment \"virtual environment\", where people can exchange information and interact with each other, not limited by space and time.\\n\\nFrom the beginning of the twenty-first century, the world entered the fourth industrial revolution. This is a revolution associated with the development of cyberspace, merging physical, digital and biological technologies, combining virtual and physical systems, fundamentally changing the way people create products, thereby creating a \"revolution\" in the organization of production - value chains. The connection and interaction through the Internet has opened a new era to promote the social development of people. type. Cyberspace has become a component and plays a very important role in building an information society and knowledge economy. Therefore, developing and mastering cyberspace is an important and urgent task of countries around the world.\\n\\nThe benefits that the Internet and social networks bring to people\\'s lives are undeniable. However, in the virtual world - that digital ecosystem, it poses many challenges for each country, each people and moreover for all mankind, especially in assessing the authenticity of information. network, such as: The relationship between men and women… marriage, family; socio-economic situation to issues related to national security such as: East Sea situation, Vietnam - China - US relations...; are difficult to determine, difficult to verify the truthfulness of the information they receive or are interested in. This leads to bad guys being able to take advantage of the Internet and social networks for evil purposes, such as: Giving sensational information to catch views, sentences like; giving information about private life due to narrowness, selfishness... More dangerously, cyberspace is also a favorable environment to activate cyber weapons in overthrowing the political institutions of some countries where Events \"Arab Spring\" or \"Jasmine revolution\"… are concrete examples. The use of cyberspace for terrorist activities, spreading terrorism, extremism, and military recruitment increasingly seriously threatens national security, emerging as an activity of the \"Islamic State\" organization. self-proclaimed IS\".\\n\\nFrom there, it can be seen that, in today\\'s era, issues of national security, social order and safety and human rights are facing new challenges. If in the past, national security was the protection of the sovereignty of the land, sea, airspace, social regime, etc., today, it is also the protection of cyber security. Former US President Barack Obama has said that: \"Cybersecurity threats have become one of the most dangerous national security and economic challenges facing the United States\" and \"the Internet has now become a weapon of destruction. mass extermination” (2)[2].\\n\\nMany countries are well aware of threats to cyber security, consider this a new challenge, a new threat of high importance and danger, so they have concretized it into policies, laws or documents. Under the law, established a specialized force on cybersecurity, cyber intelligence, cyber warfare, and prevention of cyber-terrorism and cybercrime in more than 80 countries, organizations and international alliances such as the US, UK , Germany, the Netherlands, France, Canada, Korea, NATO... to create institutions and legal bases against threats to national security from cyberspace.(3)[3]\\n\\nIn Vietnam, the strong application and development of information technology in the fields of social life has greatly contributed to speeding up the process of industrialization and modernization of the country, economic and cultural development. culture, society, improve the quality of health care and education, bring into play the people\\'s creativity and mastery, and maintain security and national defense. However, from the perspective of national security and social order and safety, it is this development that causes many negative problems, bad guys and hostile forces easily use telecommunications networks and the Internet. to propagate, sabotage ideology, sabotage internal affairs, incite protests, cause disturbances and riots in order to overthrow the government and change the political regime in our country. Appeared thousands of electronic information pages, blogs, social networking sites such as Zalo, Viber, Twitter ... especially Facebook, with bad content, posting depraved, violent publications, contrary to the fine customs and traditions of Vietnam. ethnic. Cyber \\u200b\\u200bintelligence activities, cybercriminals are increasingly sophisticated and cunning, causing increasingly serious consequences...(4)[4]. They used hackers to attack the network, causing economic and social harm; Typically, hackers attacked a series of websites of domestic airports (March 2017)[5], causing many flights to be interrupted or canceled, causing great economic losses.\\n\\nDuring the period from June 10 to 11 2018, hostile forces at home and abroad colluded with each other, taking advantage of the Internet and social networks to incite mass protests and cause trouble in some provinces. , cities such as Da Nang, Nha Trang, Binh Thuan, Ho Chi Minh City ... when the National Assembly discussed the Draft Law on Special Zones,[6] passed the Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\nTherefore, the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is necessary to create a solid legal basis in identifying and handling acts that infringe upon national security, social order and safety, especially are acts of infringing upon human rights, legitimate rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\n2. The provisions of the Law on Cybersecurity related to the protection of human rights in cyberspace\\n\\nAccording to the explanation of the Drafting Board, the content of the Law on Cybersecurity is consistent with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations General Assembly\\'s Declaration on Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on civil and political rights in 1966,[7] and other relevant documents, in accordance with the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Penal Code, and the Vietnam Civil Code. The provisions of the Cybersecurity Law directly protect 05 human rights, specifically:\\n\\nThe right to life, liberty and security of the individual; the right to equality before the law and to be protected by the law; The right not to interfere with your privacy, family, residence or correspondence; The right not to be infringed upon personal honor or reputation; Citizens\\' right to freedom of thought, belief and religion; Citizens\\' right to freedom of speech and expression. At the same time, the provisions of the Law on Cybersecurity also create a basis to help authorities carry out activities to prevent and handle acts of using cyberspace to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of organizations. organizations and individuals.\\n\\nArticle 8 of the Law on Cybersecurity specifically and clearly lists prohibited acts on network security, including acts that infringe on human rights, including some of the following acts:\\n\\nFirstly, using cyberspace to perform the following acts: Organizing, operating, colluding, instigating, bribing, deceiving, enticing, training, and training people against the State of the Socialist Republic Vietnam; Distorting history, denying revolutionary achievements, undermining the great national unity bloc, insulting religion, discriminating against gender and race; Misinformation causing confusion among the people, causing damage to socio-economic activities, causing difficulties for the operation of state agencies or official duty performers, infringing upon the lawful rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals other persons; Prostitution, social evils, human trafficking; posting lewd, depraved, criminal information; undermining the nation\\'s fine customs and traditions, social morality and the health of the community; Instigating, enticing and inciting others to commit crimes.\\n\\nSecondly, Producing, putting into use tools, means, software or obstructing or disrupting the operation of telecommunications networks, Internet, computer networks, information systems, processing systems, etc. management and control of information and electronic means; spreading informatics programs that harm the operation of telecommunications networks, the Internet, computer networks, information systems, information processing and control systems, and electronic means; illegally infiltrating telecommunications networks, computer networks, information systems, information processing and control systems, databases and electronic means of others.\\n\\nThirdly, Taking advantage of or abusing cybersecurity protection activities to infringe upon the sovereignty, interests, national security, social order and safety, lawful rights and interests of agencies and organizations, personally or for personal gain.\\n\\nThus, acts that infringe on human rights such as: The right to life, freedom and personal security; interference with privacy, family, residence or correspondence; harm personal honor or reputation; infringing upon citizens\\' right to freedom of thought, belief and religion… are strictly prohibited by the Cybersecurity Law. At the same time, the Law on Cybersecurity does not contain prohibitive regulations on foreign service providers such as: Facebook, Google...; Citizens are not prohibited from participating in cyberspace activities or accessing and using information in cyberspace... However, in the case of individuals and organizations using cyberspace to commit violations. the law will be dealt with.\\n\\nThe handling of violations of the law on network security shall be carried out based on the provisions of Article 9 of the Law on Cybersecurity. Accordingly, depending on the nature and seriousness of the violation, the violator may be disciplined, administratively handled or examined for penal liability. under the law.\\n\\nIn terms of human rights, rights and interests of individuals, organizations, and businesses, the Law on Cybersecurity is completely free of any restrictions.any violation against the legitimate rights and interests of these subjects. On the contrary, the Law on Cybersecurity is an effective legal tool to protect legitimate rights and interests so that people and businesses can get rid of information \"pollution\", such as ensuring air, drinking water and information security. clean food for human health.\\n\\nIt can be said that there is no law that provides as many provisions to protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals in cyberspace as the Law on Cybersecurity and never before has children\\'s rights in cyberspace been protected. such protection.(1)[8]\\n\\nDespite the benefits, the necessity of enacting the Law on Cybersecurity in Vietnam is undeniable. However, the very birth and application of sanctions of the Law on Cybersecurity is also a barrier for many opponents to take advantage of cyberspace against the Party and State. They misrepresent and believe that the handling of fake news, false information and malicious information is a violation of human rights and freedom of speech. Therefore, they devised many sophisticated and cunning tricks to slander and distort the superiority of the Cybersecurity Law, incite and call on people to take to the streets to protest against the National Assembly passing the Security Law. Internet with fabricated claims such as: The Cybersecurity Law is \"against humanity\", \"silences democracy\", \"suppresses dissent\", \"creates business barriers\", \"increasing costs for enterprises\", \"adding sublicenses\", \"abusing power\", \"banning the use of Facebook, Google\"[9]... When researching and being well aware of the Cybersecurity Law, it can be affirmed: \"Absolutely not There is a story that the Cybersecurity Law infringes on privacy, freedom of expression and the right to use the Internet.” We clearly see that the Law on Cybersecurity does not have the above provisions, does not create barriers, does not increase administrative procedures, does not grant sublicenses and does not hinder the normal and lawful operation of organizations and individuals. On the contrary, the Law is protecting the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations in cyberspace.[10]\\n\\nThus, the provisions restricting the right to protect national security, public order and individual rights specified in the Cybersecurity Law are fully compatible with international human rights law.[11] The negative reaction to the Cybersecurity Law by bad actors is understandable. Because, with hostile forces, political opportunists, anti-regime and anti-State elements, this is a legal tool, depriving them of important weapons that they can use to accomplish their goals. goal of opposing, overthrowing and transforming our regime into the path of \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" imported from abroad. On the contrary, for the State and our people, the promulgation and strict implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity is one of the important guarantees and an effective measure to ensure human rights, legitimate rights and interests. of citizens. This is a legal weapon to prevent and handle abusive and abusive acts in order to protect national security, social order and safety, human rights and citizens\\' rights.\\n\\nOne thing is for sure, a prerequisite for human rights to be protected is a peaceful, stable, free and equal environment. In other words, it must be a country without wars, ethnic conflicts, religious conflicts and political conflicts. We see very clearly the consequences of countries affected by the \"Arab Spring\" movement, such as: Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Libya... What they wanted at that time was democracy and human rights. and a prosperous life for the people. But the actual outcome is war, destruction, famine, looting, death and suffering, causing tens of thousands of people to flee their homeland, creating a massive migration wave to the neighboring countries. European countries and other countries.

Because we live in an era of information saturation, the more unique, strange, creepy, and violent news is, the more it attracts online users.\\n\\nSocial networks develop like a storm with the connection of hundreds of millions of people on the planet with positive and negative sides. The negative side is evident when fake news is not controlled and the “creator” who spreads fake news is not responsible for his or her actions. Cyberspace is increasingly being used by criminal, terrorist, anti-subversive and extremist groups to cause social disturbances, smear individuals, organizations, and even an entire country. The Chicago Board of Crime Prevention and Control (USA) said that more than 50 criminal groups here use social networks - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ... to trade drugs and carry out illegal activities. other.\\n\\nInformation from Google technology company shows that in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, the Internet is developing at the fastest pace on Earth with an online community of more than 400 million people. This also entails \"hidden corners\" from social networks.\\n\\nThe Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education has called on the authorities to strictly monitor social networking sites to prevent the spread of extremist ideology among young people, especially students.

(Photo: Hoa Mai/Vietnam+)\\n\\nMedia expert Le Quoc Minh (Deputy General Director of Vietnam News Agency) in his presentations to journalists in Vietnam has repeatedly affirmed not to underestimate fake news and must have a sense of prevention early. Fake news has been quietly appearing in Vietnam for a long time, but few people pay attention. Even if fake news becomes a \"global crisis\" after the US presidential election, many people in the country still do not take it seriously.\\n\\nBut it can be affirmed that fake news is really a threat to society. In the world, fake news is rampant and Vietnam is no exception to this trend. We have seen a lot of innocuous, even misleading, content that has been widely distributed by social media users. Among those who share such false information on social networks, there are also reputable, influential figures, even said to be \"more knowledgeable\" than many other users, such as journalists. newspaper.\\n\\nAccording to expert Le Quoc Minh, Internet users must be careful, consider and verify information before \"entering the mind\" or sharing with others information that is spread online, especially about sensitive issues. affecting national security, national economy and social order.\\n\\nBefore the Law on Cybersecurity took effect, the sanctions in the 2017 Penal Code were not enough of a deterrent against slanderous and insulting acts that smeared the image of the country and the reputation of organizations and individuals. There has been a breach of the law.\\n\\nAccording to the general perception in the online community in Vietnam, the fact that “false information causes confusion among people…,” in other words, “fake news,” is not a serious violation of the law. , even just the act of \"joking, amusing,\" at most only being \"reminded.\"\\n\\nHowever, the Law on Cybersecurity stipulates very clearly in Article 9 - Handling of violations of the law on cyber security: \"Whoever commits acts of violating the provisions of this Law shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, if they are disciplined, administratively handled or examined for penal liability, if causing damage, they must pay compensation in accordance with law.\"\\n\\nThus, the birth of the Cybersecurity Law is a timely and necessary decision to protect national security, social order and also protect network users themselves, and at the same time build a healthy network environment. safe.\\n\\nIt is time for network users to be highly conscious of their behavior on social networks if they do not want to bear civil and even criminal liability.'\n",

However, besides those great benefits, cyberspace also poses many risks and challenges, directly affecting sovereignty, national security and social order and safety, legitimate rights and interests. legislation of organizations and individuals. Faced with the above fact, on June 12, 2018, at the 5th session of the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, term XIV, passed the Law on Cybersecurity No. 24/2018/QH14, which took effect. from January 1, 2019. It can be affirmed that the introduction of the Law has contributed to perfecting the legal basis to protect the sovereignty, interests, national security, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals participating in activities on the Internet. cyberspace; building a healthy cyber environment...\\n \\nThe Law on Cybersecurity consists of 7 chapters and 43 articles, stipulating the basic contents of cybersecurity protection for information systems important for national security; prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security; deploying network security protection activities and stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals. The law was prepared meticulously and thoroughly, with the participation and comments of ministries, functional agencies, more than 30 large telecommunications and information technology enterprises in the country such as VNPT, FPT, BKAV; many domestic and foreign experts, economic and telecommunications groups, including Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, the US-ASEAN Business Council, the Asia Cloud Computing Association; foreign representative agencies such as the US, Canada, Australia, Japan... and the public opinion.\\n \\nRight after its birth, the Law on Cybersecurity has received high approval and support from the vast majority of the people because they are well aware of the practical benefits brought by the Law. This has also been proven clearly and effectively in the past time, when there are many articles and false information on the internet about the situation of the COVID-19 epidemic. Taking advantage of the complicated situation of the epidemic, many subjects have provided false information for personal gain, confusing public opinion, and affecting epidemic prevention and control. Facing that situation, local authorities across the country have stepped in fiercely. Accordingly, those who spread false information have been strictly handled according to the provisions of law; Social networks must remove the above information and publish official information from the competent authority.\\n \\nAccording to Major General Nguyen Van Giang, Deputy Director of the Department of Cybersecurity and High-Tech Crime Prevention - Ministry of Public Security, over the past time, the police force has made a list of hundreds of objects and organized summons. , fought nearly 200 cases and administratively handled more than 30 cases of spreading false information about the COVID-19 epidemic. In Nghe An, recently, there have also been 7 cases of being summoned by the authorities to work for spreading false information on social networks. Not only are ordinary people, over time, some artists in Ho Chi Minh City have also had to work with the authorities and have been fined for administrative violations for posting false information on social networks. about the COVID-19 situation.\\n \\nThis once again affirms that anyone, regardless of position or work in any field, if living, studying and working in the territory of Vietnam, the compliance with the laws of Vietnam is an inevitability.\\n \\nBack in early 2019 - the time when the new Law on Cybersecurity was promulgated, besides the support of the vast majority of the people, there were still some conflicting opinions. Even many subjects with bad intentions and motives took advantage of the situation to incite and claim that some of the contents specified in the Law would \"violate human rights and stifle freedom and democracy.\" , freedom of speech\". However, reality has proven quite the opposite. The introduction of the Law has really made the environment of cyberspace become much more cultural and healthier because of information with bad content, affecting moral standards, fine customs and traditions of the country. have been prevented and handled seriously and effectively while the people\\'s right to freedom of speech is still guaranteed as long as such activities are within the limits permitted by Vietnamese law. As for the trading and exchange of goods in cyberspace over the past 1 year, it has still taken place smoothly. The actual recognition shows that most business subjects support the Law coming to life with specific and strict regulations in this field.\\n \\nAccording to statistics, up to now, nearly 140 countries have enacted Cybersecurity Laws with the common goal of better ensuring security and safety in cyberspace. This is the most concrete and clear evidence for the effectiveness of the Law in recent years. HoweverHowever, in order for the Cybersecurity Law to continue to be more effective in the coming time, in addition to the efforts and efforts of the authorities in the process of perfecting the legal system, it is more important that each Internet users need to be very alert to choose reliable information; especially to live, study and work with a serious and effective spirit of respecting Vietnamese law'\n",

This is the purpose that all countries in the world have stipulated in their laws to protect their sovereignty, national interests, national security, and legitimate rights and interests of citizens.\\n\\nCitizens\\' legitimate rights and interests are always protected\\n\\nThe Law on ANM also stipulates that the principle of ANM protection is \"guaranteeing the interests of the State, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals\". The State applies all measures to protect national cyberspace; prevent and handle acts infringing upon national security, social order and safety, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals on cyberspace. This Law also prohibits all acts of infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals specified in Article 8.\\n\\nObviously, \"lawful rights and interests of organizations and individuals\" are protected by the ANM Law and the State will apply all measures to implement such protection. In particular, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals are protected most clearly in Chapter III, which fully prescribes measures to prevent, fight and handle in order to eliminate threats. , detect and handle violations of the law. Accordingly, users only violate this law and will be handled when using cyberspace to propagate against the State, incite riots, disrupt security, disrupt public order, humiliate, slander, invade violate the economic management order (such as promoting false information about goods, fraud...), infringing on business secrets, personal secrets, family secrets and private lives of others...\\n\\nThe violations of the law prescribed in the Law on ANM have also been scatteredly regulated in 29 articles of the Criminal Law of our country. Many countries around the world have very specific provisions in their ANM Law to regulate the above acts.\\n\\nThe Federal Republic of Germany based on their Criminal Law to develop the Security Law, in which there are 25 articles that stipulate the prohibited acts and handling when using cyberspace to operate to conspire to use violence to overthrow the National Security. , instructing others to use violence to threaten national security, instigating criminal acts, disrupting public order by threatening to use illegal acts, etc.\\n\\nThus, the ANM Laws of other countries and Vietnam prevent threats to national sovereignty and ethnicity, threats to infringe upon citizens\\' legitimate rights and interests, against bad guys, not \"against human\". This law prohibits the use of cyberspace to appeal against the government, terrorism, threaten the interests of users, etc., does not prohibit people from free speech, freedom to express opinions, such regulations are very democratic.\\n\\nIn particular, the ANM Law to prevent unauthorized collection of user information like Facebook, which leaked the information of at least 87 million users around the world, was discovered in March 2018, of which Vietnam has 427,446 user accounts whose data has been collected.\\n\\nThat rule is to protect users. Therefore, all citizens can feel secure, freely trade and exchange information on cyberspace if they do not violate the provisions of the ANM Law. Only those who operate shady, non-transparent on cyberspace are concerned.\\n\\nThere is no such thing as Google, Facebook leaving Vietnam\\n\\nSome comments are concerned that the provisions of the ANM Law will make Google and Facebook leave Vietnam. However, Google and Facebook are service companies with the aim of making a lot of profit, so they have compromised with governments in other countries to choose a safe, legal solution that is not fined or banned. .\\n\\nTherefore, they themselves approached the drafting committee to develop Vietnam\\'s ANM Law to negotiate and accept the provisions of the draft law, so that they could still operate in the Vietnamese market safely. secure and still earn legitimate profits under Vietnamese law, without being prohibited. On the other hand, currently Google has set up about 70 representative offices, Facebook about 80 representative offices in countries around the world to operate and make profits.\\n\\nAt a meeting with the Ministry of Information and Communications on April 26, 2017, Ms. Monika Bickert, Facebook\\'s global head of product policy, affirmed that she would cooperate with the Government of Vietnam and pledged: \"All Contents of sexual abuse, hate attacks, libelous information, insulting others\\' reputation... will have no place to hide and we are committed to removing bad, toxic, illegal information. Vietnam on the social network Facebook; Let\\'s work together to build a healthy and safe network environment in Vietnam\".\\n\\nIt can be seen that the hostile forces\\' plots against our State never change, so they find every way to distort the truth, by all means to influence a part that lacks understanding of cyberspace. , on e-commerce, to protest the promulgation of the ANM Law. Everyone should be cautious, alert, do not turn themselves into a toolpropaganda without pay, aiding the hostile forces, for the bad guys.

Since then, raising awareness in the use of information services, especially services provided by foreign countries; improve political bravery, the ability to recognize and receive information, self-defense ability, \"immunity\" against fake, bad and malicious information. There is a plan to include content on identifying risks and factors causing information insecurity and responsibility for ensuring information security into the national education system, thereby educating awareness, responsibility, improving public awareness on this issue.\\n\\nSecond, to study to establish national sovereignty in cyberspace, to ensure the preservation of national independence, autonomy, sovereignty and interests in the international information space; effectively protect and exploit national information resources.\\n\\nVietnam needs to selectively absorb international experience, focus on research, and establish a national cyberspace (with infrastructure, services, and legal framework) in order to soon assert its national sovereignty in cyberspace. . Identify the constitutive elements and promote solutions to effectively enforce national sovereignty in the information space: (1) Develop hardware technology to ensure autonomy in means and equipment, especially is the core network system, computer, telephone, information infrastructure; (2) Developing software technology to create its own software ecosystem, including: operating system, search engine, social network and service applications on the Internet; (3) Develop own security technology and security inspection and monitoring system in order to actively detect, prevent, block and filter fake, bad and malicious information; (4) Building an integrated, interconnected and secure national database system (Big Data) to facilitate digital transformation and digital economy development; (5) Building a modern, safe and responsible information-oriented and propaganda system; separate attack and defense systems, especially key information systems of the Party and State and in the field of security and defense; (6) Building and perfecting institutions, policies, laws and a developed service market.\\n\\nFirst of all, it is necessary to have a specific mechanism to concentrate resources to build up Vietnam\\'s own social network, search engine, and utility operating system that is compatible with international standards and has a strong foothold in the market. school and in society. This, on the one hand, affirms the country\\'s position, ensures independence, self-reliance and national sovereignty in cyberspace, gradually reduces dependence on foreign technology, improves security and autonomy in ensuring information security, ensuring national economic interests, facilitating the preservation and promotion of national cultural values, taking the initiative in receiving information and facilitating in information and propaganda of the Party and State, effectively preventing bad and harmful information, increasing the ability to ensure the confidentiality of users\\' personal information. At the same time, it is necessary to have a reasonable plan to exploit and protect national information resources to serve economic and social development, and to ensure national defense and security.\\n\\nThird, strengthen the leadership and direction of the Party, the centralized and unified management of the State, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of state management of information security. Focus on developing and perfecting policies and laws on information security assurance, creating a legal environment to ensure safety and reliability for the digital economy, for the sharing of digital data, for management. manage the operation of enterprises providing information services across the border into Vietnam. Continue to study and develop laws on anti-fake information, bad and harmful information; personal information protection law. There is a mechanism to publicly monitor, block and filter misleading and untruthful information in cyberspace; specific regulations and strictly implement the mandatory use of real information when registering an account online.

Regularly review, detect and fix security holes throughout the system, add specialized equipment and software capable of checking and controlling security and information safety in the telecommunications network environment. internet, radio frequencies, etc. Develop, deploy and implement specialized technical solutions to check and detect risks of information insecurity. Organize annual drills on national-level cyberattack prevention and control with the participation of government agencies, key economic groups, enterprises providing telecommunications and Internet services and agencies, relevant organizations, ensuring timely handling of risks causing insecurity, threatening to cause information insecurity in Vietnam.\\n\\nFocusing on forecasting and implementing solutions to combat and neutralize the activities of infringing upon the information security of the subjects, especially the attack activities that paralyze the important national information system; the intention to use artificial intelligence (Al), big data (big data) to manipulate and provoke public opinion, creating conditions to promote the \"color revolution\" in Vietnam; and conspiracies and intentions of hostile forces, hegemony to militarize the information space, and to launch an information war against Vietnam.\\n\\nFifth, concentrate resources to build and gradually develop the information technology industry, especially the information security (cybersecurity) industry of Vietnam.\\n\\nWith the current resources of Vietnam, it is necessary to focus on developing the information security industry in the direction of dual-use, combining both in the civil field with ensuring security and defense; public-private partnership. The State needs to have a special mechanism, immediately implement solutions to take shortcuts, take the initiative to gradually master and export information technology. Encourage research, development, useg Vietnam\\'s own software and information services, meeting the requirements of information security, the safety of state secrets, and network security monitoring. Building strong domestic information technology enterprises, providing telecommunications and Internet services, mastering the market, forming a force of service-providing enterprises capable of self-manufacturing security equipment. information.\\n\\nThe Government should promulgate a mechanism to encourage, support and mobilize organizations and individuals to start-up in cybersecurity technology, information technology enterprises, and domestic telecommunications and internet service providers to master market; forming enterprises capable of self-manufacturing, providing services, equipment and solutions associated with network security protection, increasing the localization rate of information technology products. Establish investment funds for research and development of solutions to ensure information security.\\n\\nIn the era of industrial revolution 4.0, information security has become an increasingly important content of national security. Research on information security, ensuring information security is therefore always an urgent requirement today.

      " 'Currently, on social networks and newspapers in some Western countries, there have appeared arguments linking the Cybersecurity Law (ANM Law) with human rights issues in our country.\\n\\nHowever, it is an obvious fact that the ANM law is not a \"specialty\" of Vietnam alone, but many countries around the world have been applying the ANM law with different names. And the common purpose is to ensure that activities in the internet space do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, and the legitimate rights and interests of agencies, organizations as well as individual users. network.\\n\\nIn the world, ANM is an urgent issue in the context of increasing global cybercrime activities. Cybercrime can be fraud on the internet, putting computer viruses into the computer systems of state agencies and businesses. It is the act of stealing network user account information and passwords. It is also the fabrication and sharing of fake news, smearing individuals, groups, social classes or above, an entire country or nation...\\n\\nIn the US, the issue of ANM is very important. On October 27, 2015, the US Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Bill (CISA) to create a solid defense system in cyberspace. Recently, the US Government has also issued a number of new regulations on ANM, amending the old regulations to make the issue of ANM more closely guaranteed. These are the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, the Federal Exchange Data Breach Notification Act, and the National Cybersecurity Enhancement Act as amended. And despite having the most secure security system in the world, America is still not safe from cyberattacks. In July 2017, hackers breached the systems of Equifax, one of the three largest credit bureaus in the US, to steal the personal data of 145 million people.\\n\\nIn the European Union (EU) the first ANM Law came into effect in May 2018. Organizations, businesses and individuals using the network are required to strictly comply with the provisions of this law or they will be severely fined.\\n\\nIn Germany, in July 2015, the National Assembly passed the ANM Law to prevent crime on the internet. This law contains specific provisions for users of social networks, including the prohibition of inciting the use of violence to infringe upon national security, the prohibition of inciting illegal acts, the dissemination of ideological extreme...\\n\\nIn Australia, the legal framework on ANM is considered to be complete, including the Law on Cybercrime, the Law on Spam Email, the Law on Telecommunications and the Law on Privacy.\\n\\nIn Japan in November 2014 Basic Law on ANM was promulgated. According to this law, the Government of Japan developed the ANM strategy and established the ANM Strategic Command with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of ANM policies.\\n\\nIn Singapore the powers of the ANM Authority were greatly expanded. According to the ANM Bill, which was submitted to the National Assembly not long ago, this agency is allowed to proactively apply necessary measures to ensure national cyber security. Organizations, businesses and individuals are forced to cooperate immediately with the ANM Agency to fight cybercrime. Non-cooperative subjects can be imprisoned for up to 10 years.\\n\\nThailand, on the other hand, applies very strict internet censorship laws. Congress passed the Computer Crimes Act in December 2016. According to this law, a 5-year prison sentence is given to those who post fabricated and false information on the Internet that undermine national security, social safety, national economic stability, infrastructure, etc. public facilities or cause confusion among the public. A five-member committee was set up to remove information online that \"violated social ethics\". Maybe. 128 million baht (equivalent to 3 million USD) will be spent to equip social network tracking technology.\\n\\nVietnam is said to be a vulnerable country to cybercrime. Our country ranks 100th in the world and is at the bottom of the ASEAN region in terms of ANM. Because ANM is not guaranteed, in 2017 information systems in Vietnam suffered about 15,000 cyber attacks, causing about 12,300 billion VND in damage. The ANM vulnerability puts Vietnam at great risk when entering the 4.0 industrial revolution.\\n\\nRecently, on social networks, there has been a lot of distorting and inciting information in order to sabotage political security and destabilize the socio-economic order; threaten national independence, sovereignty, regime survival, slander and smear organizations, mass organizations, enterprises and individuals.\\n\\nTypically, the case of some subjects posting cropped and distorted images on Facebook, Youtube, etc., inciting protests and riots under the pretext of opposing the Law on Special Zones and the Law on Cybersecurity. One of the sad consequences of this trick is that on the afternoon of June 10, 2018, many extremists in Binh Thuan blocked Highway 1, flooding into the headquarters of the Provincial People\\'s Committee, the Department of Planning and Investment, and attacked the security forces. protect and destroy property.\\n\\nThere are times in Vietnam when fake news on social media usurps the power to lead public opinion and overwhelm press agencies. Readers are immersed in the sea of \\u200b\\u200btrue and false information, and the danger is that the percentage of readers who believe in fake information is very high. According to Bkav (the companyexperts on cybersecurity in Vietnam), up to 63% of internet users regularly read fake news on Facebook and are affected by them.\\nThere are many examples of this:\\n\\nIn July 2017, the national public was stirred by information about the plane crash at Noi Bai airport, accompanied by pictures of chaos at the airport. Then the functional forces investigated and discovered the fact that a Facebook user had fabricated to \"catch likes\", to serve the cosmetic business.\\n\\nIn February 2017, Facebook also appeared on a fan page impersonating \"The Police Newspaper\" and posted a clip about the case of an overseas Vietnamese demanding \"confrontation\" with Tan San Nhat airport staff because they thought that luggage was stolen at the airport.

As a result, the aforementioned fake news has created a distorted and ugly image of the country and people of Vietnam.\\n\\nIn the past time, social networks have been racing to post information about child abductions (which are not real) in one province, another province, causing panic, affecting the security and order situation in other provinces. direction…\\n\\nVietnam\\'s ANM Law was born in that context and is an urgent requirement of real life.\\n\\nThe ANM Law is not \"falling from the sky\" but is a systematization and legalization of Vietnam\\'s regulations on cyber security management that have been promulgated before. The ANM Law has the purpose of regulating relationships in cyberspace in order to protect national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\nIt should be clearly understood that the ANM Law of Vietnam does not contain any provisions restricting citizens\\' right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The fact that this Law concretizes prohibited acts when exercising citizens\\' rights to freedom of speech and freedom of the press is because these acts have been defined as violations of the law in the Penal Code.\\n\\nThose who believe that the ANM Law violates freedom, democracy and human rights are those who have a one-sided view, prejudice, lack of objectivity, ignoring the fact that freedom, democracy and human rights are the rights of every child. people, provided that those rights do not infringe on the freedom, democracy and human rights of others, the community, the nation, or the nation!'\n",

In fact, at that time, Nam Mo Hydropower was carrying out flood discharge according to the process to ensure the safety of property and people\\'s lives, so the water on the Nam Mo River was rising. Tuan\\'s comments caused confusion and worry for people in Ky Son and Tuong Duong districts.\\nMany families have relocated their properties because they believe in the information written by Tuan. After conducting the verification, Ky Son District Police worked and asked Luong Ngoc Tuan to immediately delete the above comment and post an apology to the people on his personal page. Tuan was also later signed by the Chairman of the Ky Son District People\\'s Committee to impose an administrative fine of 12.5 million VND for posting false information on the social network Facebook.\\nOr as recently, Mr. Le Huu Thuan- Deputy Secretary of the Party cell, Head of the Faculty of Marxist-Leninist Theory, Ho Chi Minh Thought (Tran Phu School of Politics, Ha Tinh province) has just been suspended from his post. The reason is that he posted false information about the health of senior officials of the Party and State on his personal Facebook page. Currently, the Inspection Committee of the Party Committee of Ha Tinh Province\\'s Agencies and Enterprises is considering the extent of Mr. Le Huu Thuan\\'s violations to make a decision to discipline him. Obviously, this is an act that shows signs of serious violation of the Cybersecurity Law and the Party\\'s and State\\'s regulations, especially what party members are not allowed to do. Mr. Thuan\\'s work has seriously affected his own honor and reputation of the Party organization and the school, causing frustration among cadres, party members and public opinion.\\n\\nHundreds of people in Xa Luong commune, Tuong Duong district went to the mountain because of false information about the collapse of the Ban Ve Hydropower Dam on social networks.

Documentary photos\\nThe case of Luong Ngoc Tuan, or Mr. Le Huu Thuan is just one of many examples of unverified information but untrue comments and opinions on Facebook just for the reason \"for fun\". \". Or like child abduction information, over time, the frequency and density of people posting, sharing and commenting is quite dense on social networks. When the authorities verify, the information is not true. However, as a result, many people believed, and from there acted wrongly. If according to the Law on Cybersecurity, these are all illegal acts and will be strictly handled according to regulations.\\nIt must be affirmed again that the National Assembly\\'s promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is necessary, thereby ensuring national security, social order and safety and the legitimate interests of organizations and individuals. Therefore, people need to have a full awareness and a correct attitude towards acts in cyberspace. All violations will be strictly handled in accordance with the law, without exception and cannot be justified as \"for fun\", \"don\\'t know\".'\n",
      " 'In that context, the fact that some domestic and foreign opinions oppose Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law is an act of lack of goodwill and irresponsibility to society and people. Because of their narrow (even dark) will, they have been deliberately hindering the safe and healthy development of Vietnam.\\n\\nOn April 1, 2015, in the face of increasingly damaging cyberattacks for the United States, then-US President B.Obama issued a declaration of a national emergency with cyber-attacking activities. valid until April 1, 2018. After three years, when cyberattacks continue to be a serious threat to national security, foreign policy and the US economy (as of February 2018, the representative of the US Government published a statistical losses due to cyberattacks in the US in 2016 amounted to about 57-109 billion USD), on March 27, 2018, President D. Trump announced the extension of the national emergency with cyberattack activities. until April 1, 2018. And recently, an article on news.zing.vn said, according to The Verge, on July 17, 2018, the US Congress made a conclusion that forced Facebook to be more aggressive, even deleting illegal pages. the law; The US Congress also pointed out that some pages that attract a lot of views specialize in spreading fake information, unverified conspiracy theories such as Infowars, Milkshakes, etc. that can incite violence; US lawmakers also pressured Facebook to remove many other pages, most of which are related to political views in the US...\\n\\n \\n\\nIn Asia, on July 20, 2018, a representative of the Singapore Government said that the data system of SingHealth - the largest health insurance organization in the country, was attacked by hackers. Specifically, from May 2015 to July 2018, hackers accessed and stole personal data belonging to 1.5 million SingHealth users, including addresses, patient identification numbers who visited clinics. , hospital; In particular, the prescription information of 160,000 patients was also stolen. It is worth mentioning that Singapore is always rated as one of the world\\'s leading countries in terms of cybersecurity protection. According to the Singapore Government representative, this is a deliberate cyberattack, affecting more than 25% of Singapore\\'s population, directed at a specific target, not the work of ordinary hackers or criminal gangs. perfectly planned.\\n\\nIn another aspect, on July 25, 2018, Facebook announced that it had removed 196 pages and 87 individual accounts based on this social network\\'s platform in Brazil. These are pages and accounts used by a right-wing political group to spread fake news ahead of the Brazilian presidential election held in October 2018. Notably, the locked pages belong to a network that uses fake Facebook accounts, the owners of these pages hide the nature and origin of the posted content to intentionally create division, spread information. false news. Facebook\\'s resolute action is the result of June 2018, Facebook and Google signed an agreement with the Supreme Electoral Court in Brazil to combat the spread and dissemination of fake news...\\n\\nWith Vietnam in the trend of the fourth industrial revolution, the rapid development and change of science and technology, with the number of users as well as applications in life increasing sharply..., security issues Networking is becoming more and more important. Besides development opportunities, this field also has many potential and unpredictable consequences. Notably, cybercriminals and cyber attacks are increasing in both scale and sophistication and complexity into the nation\\'s important information infrastructure. According to statistics from the Vietnam Computer Incident Response Center (VNCERT) under the Ministry of Information and Communications, in 2017, Vietnam\\'s internet was threatened by more than 10,000 cyberattacks, causing 12.3 losses. trillion. According to VNCERT, from the beginning of 2018 to May 2018, there were 4,035 incidents of cyberattacks entering Vietnam. Recently, VNCERT said that by the end of July 2018, this center had recorded many targeted attacks by hackers into the information systems of some banks and important national infrastructure in Vietnam. . To conduct attacks, hackers perform fraudulent tricks, combine high-tech measures to bypass information security protection systems to gain control of users\\' computers, through which attacks internal computer systems that contain important information. On July 26, 2018, BKAV announced that its virus monitoring system detected a type of spying malware called BrowserSpy. This is a very dangerous computer virus because it has the ability to spy on users, collect searches, read emails and web browsing history, steal personal information, Gmail, Facebook passwords, etc. Bank accounts… According to BKAV, so far more than 560,000 computers in Vietnam have been tracked by BrowserSpy malware, and the number is continuing to increase…\\n\\nThe above news events are also enough to clearly show that cyberattacks have become a type of crime causing national insecurity, economic losses and personal insecurity, becoming a global concern... Security e-government networkhe is just a risk or a risk, but becoming a threat across borders, has been and is a problem that governments and individuals in countries have to face. And the fact also shows that today every field of social activity can always be the object of cyber attack. Cyberattacks not only target the economy, defense, technology, science, etc., but also issues of political opinion, social regime, culture, education, infrastructure, social security. , aviation management, traffic, ... are also the subject of cyber attacks. This requires that in order to protect national security, governments of countries must develop and issue legal documents not only to combat cyber attacks, but also to organize, manage, operate and handle activities. related to the internet, ensuring the safety and health of the society, and protecting citizens. That is the basis for explaining why the legal document on cyber security is a system related to all fields of social and human activities when using the internet, as Article 1 of the Law on Cybersecurity of Vietnam (effective in this regard). (effective from January 1, 2019) defines the scope of regulation: \"This Law stipulates activities to protect national security and ensure social order and safety in cyberspace; responsibilities of relevant agencies, organizations and individuals\"; and the concept of cyber security is specifically explained in Article 2: \"is the assurance that operations in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, lawful rights and interests. of organizations and individuals\". In fact, Vietnam\\'s adoption of the Law on Cybersecurity is considered by a large number of experts and the Internet user community as a necessary move to help protect Vietnam\\'s sovereignty in cyberspace as well as ensure the safety of Internet users. users before the potential risks in today\\'s network environment...\\n\\nHowever, knowing that when the Law on Cybersecurity takes effect, their impure and evil activities are at risk of facing the law more directly, so hostile forces and some organizations , individuals with a lack of goodwill have loudly protested despite the interests in the field of social and human activities mentioned by the Law on Cybersecurity. These individuals and organizations only focus on one law related to their activities to conduct a campaign of denial, slander and distortion. (Unfortunately, some governments and international organizations also joined them, deliberately exerting pressure.) For example, commenting on RFI on June 12, 2018, a so-called \"person, intellectual\" expressed his \"most worrying\" thing that the Law on Cybersecurity \"swapped the concept... to silence his mouth.\" the people… do not benefit the country, but lead astray…”. That said, it proves that this \"person\" does not care about other important contents of the Cybersecurity Law, ignoring the issue that when the Law takes effect, the economy, culture, etc. of the country are protected. how to defend. At the same time, he himself changed the concept, used the trick to turn the part into the whole, so that from a law in the Law on Cybersecurity, it did not meet his will but denied the entire legal document. According to this person\\'s one-sided approach, Vietnam does not need to protect network security, bad guys are free to attack the country\\'s infrastructure system, attack banks to steal money, mess up the public relations. operating e-government, inciting violence, selling counterfeit goods, promoting terrorism, causing aviation accidents. All individuals using the Internet in Vietnam must therefore accept that they are always at risk of being stolen personal information, bank accounts, email, Facebook... are publicly or anonymously, impersonating to spread fake news, spread false statements, oppose the country, incite opposition, spread countercultural products to poison the young generation, attack the cultural foundation nationalization, etc. can self-edit on the internet without being punished. Regrettably, these kinds of statements have misled some people\\'s thoughts, to join their voices in protest and criticism. Although many people have never studied carefully and carefully about the Cybersecurity Law before, to realize that this law is one of the legal tools that directly protects the society they live in, and protects themselves and others. Dear.\\n\\nA civilized society is a society in which all citizens have a spirit and sense of respect for the law. In order for the country to stabilize and develop, along with the efforts of the government, all citizens, professions and organizations, the sense of law observance must be one of the factors that play a dominant role, ensuring basic principles that determine the safe and healthy development of society. If you deliberately go against or destroy those principles, it is irresponsible to society and people. At the same time, it must be affirmed that Vietnam is a sovereign country, no government, no organization or individual can give themselves the right to interfere with that immutable sovereignty. Therefore, those who are trying to find all ways to slander, fabricate or distort calls for \"disobedience to the Cybersecurity Law\" should stop, do not make themselves subject to legal action.'\n",
      " 'Along with the process of international integration and development of information technology, especially the fourth technological revolution, the current situation and situation in cyberspace has set an urgent requirement in protecting security. national security, ensuring social order and safety for cybersecurity work. In order to have a legal basis to lay the foundation and conduct research, forecast and development of solutions to ensure network security - currently not focused, there is no orientation to manage and ensure network security. for future-changing technology trends such as the 4th industrial revolution, cloud computing, big data, fast data. In addition, in order to prevent and limit cyber security risks, it is necessary to develop a process and mechanism for checking and assessing the current state of network security that are appropriate and consistent across the country. At the same time, develop a mechanism to share information and notify the network security situation to raise awareness about network security and proactively prevent possible cyber security risks.\\n\\nFirstly, it is necessary to prevent, fight and frustrate activities of using cyberspace to infringe upon national security, oppose the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, propagate ideological destruction, internal sabotage, and sabotage the great bloc. unite the whole nation, incite protests, disrupt security in cyberspace of hostile and reactionary forces.\\n\\nSecond, cybersecurity work must prevent, prevent, respond to and overcome consequences of cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism. Currently, cyber attacks targeting Vietnamese information systems are increasing in number and dangerous levels. Every year, our country\\'s information network system suffers from thousands of cyber attacks, causing serious damage to national security, social order and safety, causing thousands of billions of dong loss per year and a huge amount of money. subject to conduct illegal acts of infiltration and collection of information and documents. Meanwhile, as cyber terrorism emerges as a global challenge, cyberspace has become an environment for international terrorist organizations to propagate, recruit, train and direct their operations.\\n\\n     Third, to prevent, prevent and eliminate agents conducting cyber espionage activities, appropriating state secret information and documents in cyberspace, publishing state secret information and documents. water in cyberspace. Currently, this situation is continuing to get serious.\\n\\nUnifying the focal point in emergency response to cyber security incidents\\n\\nFourth, the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity aims to protect information systems important to national security by level and apply necessary security measures. This is the information system of important national targets, important national infrastructure, and state secret agencies, so the consequences and damage will be greater than the normal information system if it is attacked. network or network security incident. These consequences and damages may adversely affect national security, cause disasters such as disrupting aviation operations, national electricity grids, road traffic systems, operating systems, etc. nuclear facilities, control systems and automatic handling of air defense systems, key industrial facilities. The protection of this information system not only includes inspection and evaluation of the operation process, but must also conduct the appraisal right from the time of building the design documents and operating the information system so that the information system can be operated quickly. detect and remove network security threats.\\n\\nFifth, regulate and unify the implementation of monitoring, forecasting, response and exercise for emergency response to cyber security incidents. Although the Law on Cyberinformation Security stipulates on responding to cyberinformation security incidents, in essence \"cyber security is the protection of information and information systems on the network from being accessed, unauthorized use, disclosure, interruption, modification or destruction in order to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information\", so response to cyberinformation security incidents can only be promoted. the role of ensuring the integrity of information and information systems, not responding to harmful agents that exist within or affected by other subjects.\\nMeanwhile, monitoring, forecasting, responding and rehearsing for emergency response to cyber security incidents is a unified process. The analysis of network security incidents directly related to crime scene traces and signs, contributes to the investigation and handling of violations of the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of National Defense. room. Therefore, unifying the focal point in monitoring, forecasting, responding and rehearsing for emergency response to cyber security incidents.\\n\\nDefine network security standards and technical regulations\\n\\nSixth, this Law stipulates standards and technical regulations on network security and licenses for business in network security assurance services. The Law on Cybersecurity raises the issue of licensing network security services because a network security service is a service that deeply interferes with the operating system, information system, and has the ability to access sensitive information. emotions, state secrets, business secrets, inside information.\\n\\nSaturday, AutumnThis law is also necessary to implement cybersecurity protection in the system of state agencies from the central to local levels, which have many unresolved security \"holes\", officials\\' awareness, employees are still limited, not aware of the necessity of network security. Information systems of state agencies are being subjected to cyberattacks, many cases of leaking and leaking state secrets have occurred, and the status of posting state secret information and documents on the internet is still not uncommon. still exist.\\n\\n      Activities to prevent and fight against the use of cyberspace to infringe upon national security, including: handling information inciting mass gatherings to disrupt security and order in cyberspace; handling information that is against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals, is contrary to morality, fine customs and traditions in cyberspace; preventing and combating cyber espionage, protecting information and documents classified as State secrets drafted, stored and exchanged in cyberspace; prevention and combat of cyber-terrorism; cyberwar prevention and combat; emergency situations on network security; measures to be applied when there is an increased risk of a cybersecurity emergency; ensuring human resources to participate in protecting national sovereignty, interests and security in cyberspace.\\n\\n    Therefore, in order for the Law to come to life soon, the authorities should soon issue specific and clear guiding documents for the Law, and at the same time have effective and practical solutions to propagate the Law.\\n\\nImportant legal corridor to protect cyberspace\\n\\nRegulations on information systems important to national security, prohibited acts on network security and information not being posted in cyberspace... are notable contents of the Cybersecurity Law.\\n\\nRegulations on important national security information systems\\n\\nThe law stipulates that an information system important for national security is an information system that is damaged, infiltrated, hijacked, falsified, interrupted, disrupted, paralyzed, attacked or sabotaged. will seriously compromise network security. Accordingly, 8 information systems have been identified in this category, including: Military, security, diplomatic, and cipher information systems; Information system that stores and processes information belonging to state secrets; An information system in service of storing and preserving artifacts and documents of particularly important value; An information system serving the preservation of materials and substances especially dangerous to humans and the ecological environment; An information system serving the preservation, manufacture and management of other particularly important facilities related to national security; An important information system serving the activities of central agencies and organizations; The national information system in the fields of energy, finance, banking, telecommunications, transportation, natural resources and environment, chemicals, healthcare, culture and press; Automated control and monitoring systems at important projects related to national security, important national security goals.\\n\\nSince then, the Law stipulates cybersecurity protection for information systems important for national security, including appraisal, assessment, monitoring, response and troubleshooting of critical information systems. National security. At the same time, the Law stipulates: “Whoever commits acts of violating the provisions of this Law shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, be disciplined, administratively sanctioned or examined for penal liability. the; if causing damage, they must compensate according to the provisions of law” - Article 9 of the Law on Cybersecurity clearly states.\\n\\nProhibited acts in cyberspace\\n\\nArticle 8 of the Law on Cybersecurity lists prohibited acts in cyberspace. Any activity that is banned is in fact banned in cyberspace.\\n\\nSpecifically, there are 06 groups of prohibited acts: Using cyberspace to organize acts of organizing, operating, colluding, instigating, bribing, deceiving, manipulating, training and training anti-government people Socialist Republic of Vietnam; Distorting history, denying revolutionary achievements, undermining the great unity bloc of the whole nation, insulting religion, discriminating against gender and racism; False information causes confusion among the people, causes damage to socio-economic activities, causes difficulties for the operation of state agencies or official duty performers, infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of the public. laws of other organizations and individuals; Prostitution, social evils, human trafficking; posting lewd, depraved, criminal information; undermining the nation\\'s fine customs and traditions, social morality and community health.

This is a law that the public thinks needs to be guided specifically in terms that are easy to understand, universal, and avoid ambiguity. Article 16 of the Law on Cybersecurity provides for the prevention and handling of information in cyberspace with propaganda content against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; inciting riots, disrupting security and disrupting public order; humiliate, slander; infringing upon the order of economic management.\\n\\nSpecifically, information on cyberspace with propaganda content against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam includes: Propaganda distorting and defaming the people\\'s administration; Psychological warfare, inciting wars of aggression, division and hatred among nations, religions and peoples of different countries; Offending the nation, the national flag, the national emblem, the national anthem, great people, leaders, famous people, national heroes.\\n\\nInformation with content that incites riots, disrupts security, or disrupts public order includes: Calling, mobilizing, instigating, threatening, divisive, conducting armed activities or using violence against the people\\'s administration; Calling, mobilizing, instigating, threatening, attracting large gatherings of people to cause trouble, oppose official duty performers, obstruct the activities of agencies and organizations, causing instability in security and order.\\n\\nArticle 16 also details information on cyberspace with content that humiliates, slanders, infringes upon the economic management order, and causes confusion among the people. Article 16 of the Law on Cybersecurity also stipulates that “The owner of an information system is responsible for implementing technical and managerial measures to prevent, detect, prevent and remove information with infringing content on the system.” information system under its management at the request of the network security protection force”.\\n\\nWhen detecting information in cyberspace with infringing content, the specialized network security protection force and competent agencies shall block or request the suspension or cessation of the provision of network information; suspending, temporarily suspending activities of setting up, providing and using telecommunications networks, the internet, manufacturing and using radio transmitters and receivers. At the same time, request the deletion, access or deletion of illegal or untrue information; suspend, temporarily suspend or request to stop the operation of the information system, revoke the domain name. Enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the internet, value-added services in cyberspace and information system owners are responsible for closely coordinating with competent authorities to handle violations. .\\n\\nWhat are the corporate responsibilities?\\n\\nRegarding regulations on information security in cyberspace, the Law requires domestic and foreign enterprises when providing services on telecommunications networks, the internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam to be responsible for: authenticate information when users register for digital accounts; secure information and user accounts; provide user information to the specialized cyber security force under the Ministry of Public Security upon written request to serve the investigation and handling of violations of the law on cyber security.\\n\\nDomestic and foreign enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam have activities of collecting, exploiting, analyzing and processing data on personal information data on the relationship of service users, data created by service users in Vietnam must store this data in Vietnam for the period prescribed by the Government.

      " 'On January 1, 2019, the Law on Cybersecurity officially took effect. This is an important legal basis, contributing to ensuring national security and maintaining social order and safety in cyberspace. It is necessary to have a system of legal documents regulating acts in cyberspace because:\\n\\nTheoretically, Cybersecurity is the assurance that operations in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. From that, it can be seen that cybersecurity is a part of national security, making an important contribution to ensuring national interests in the digital age.\\n\\n– In practical terms, cyberspace is like a second “society” that exists in parallel with the society we live in, the special thing is that this “society” has no distance in space, time and space. However, the presence of regulations and sanctions for supervision, management and handling here is still very faint. The past time has also shown that there are many people who take advantage of cyberspace for propaganda activities, inciting gatherings, disrupting security and order for the purpose of opposing the people\\'s administration.\\n\\nFrom the above reasons, on June 12, 2018, the National Assembly approved the Draft Law on Cybersecurity with 86.86% of the votes in favor, the Law on Regulations of Behavior in Cyberspace, of which 06 groups were proposed. prohibited behavior. However, right after the National Assembly passed the Draft Law on Cybersecurity, many domestic and foreign opponents propagated and provoked people to oppose this bill, arguing that the Cybersecurity Law was unconstitutional. , \"invasion of privacy\", \"infringement of citizens\\' freedom of expression\", said that the content of the Cybersecurity Law is ambiguous, no country in the world has this law.\\n\\nIn general, the above misrepresentations \"hit\" the psychology of users\\' desire to \"protect privacy\" in cyberspace, thereby giving false perceptions about the Cybersecurity Law, implicitly ignoring through the benefits from the enactment of the Cybersecurity Law. It should be understood that the Law on Cybersecurity is not a \"tool\" for the State to strengthen its control over the people, suffocating freedom of information and freedom of expression. On the contrary, the Cybersecurity Law contributes to ensuring a healthy cyberspace environment, more specifically, the Cybersecurity Law \"hits\" those elements that cause insecurity and safety in the network environment. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that after the National Assembly passed the Draft Law on Cybersecurity, reactionaries and opponents at home and abroad actively distort and incite \"movements\" to protest against the arguments that are not valid. power \"for the country\", \"for the people\", but the real goal of the subjects is to prevent the building of a strong enough legal corridor in cyberspace, a real \"barrier\" for activities. activities against the Party, State and People.\\n\\nNearly a month since the Law on Cybersecurity took effect, in addition to distorting and inciting articles by domestic and foreign opposers, there have been a number of comments on social networks with sentences in the form of: like \"This comment has been hidden because of the Cybersecurity law, this account holder will be handled according to the law\". It is worth mentioning that the above comments are written in an italic/bold/light font that is quite different from the website\\'s default.\\n\\nA\\n\\nBesides, there are joking comments about acts regulated by the Cybersecurity Law. The appearance of the above two content has been responded by a large number of social network users. This seemingly harmless joke has huge consequences, it causes misunderstandings for people, especially young people, about violations of the Cybersecurity Law, saying that the Cybersecurity Law is \"tools\" for the Government to monitor and collect user information, use the pretext of \"cybersecurity\" to regulate even the smallest behavior on social networks, and tighten freedom of expression.\\n\\nThe fact that we are living in a civilized society, the behavior is regulated by law and human morality. Therefore, the Law on Cybersecurity is just a concretization of regulations in daily life, applied to the cyberspace environment. There is no reason for acts in “real space” to be dealt with by applicable law (e.g. slander, insult to dignity or honor of others or propagate or incite illegal protests. ) can be done openly, legally in “virtual space”. As a citizen who has been abiding by the laws of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, we can rest assured that the Law on Cybersecurity is the \"shield\" showing the State\\'s role in security. protect Internet users and, more broadly, the national and national interests in cyberspace against threats that have been and are present every day, every hour.'\n",
      " 'In recent days, before, during and after the National Assembly passed the Law on Cybersecurity and the announcement of the President\\'s Order on this Law, domestic and foreign public opinion was very concerned. However, hiding under the guise of \"free speech\", taking advantage of the Party\\'s policy of \"Appreciating the role of scientific research agencies in consulting, criticizing, and assessing the society in policy making. , the Party\\'s guidelines, the State\\'s policies and laws, and economic, cultural and social development projects\"[1], opportunists and hostile forces at home and abroad. there are tricks to distort the Cybersecurity Law for the purpose of causing information chaos, creating mistrust and bad public opinion in society; thereby, distorting the correct guidelines and policies of the Party and State on promulgating laws. Therefore, it is very urgent to identify and fight against the distortion of the current Cybersecurity Law.\\n\\n \\n\\n1. Identify allegations that distort the current Cybersecurity Law\\n\\n \\n\\nFirstly, opportunists and hostile forces at home and abroad think that our promulgation of the Cybersecurity Law is a temporary measure of our Party and State to deal with dissenters. political opinion. It is not difficult to recognize those false and out of place claims of foreign news agencies, press and domestic political opportunists \"like poisonous mushrooms after the rain\" of BBC, RFA, VOA, RFI stations. ... Typically VOA Vietnamese with a series of articles full of distortions such as: \"A movement to disobey the Cybersecurity Law\" ... and on the internet, social networks, there is some information that the Law on Cybersecurity Law \"Invasion of privacy\"; “infringement on freedom of speech and civil rights”; “robbing people of the right to use the internet” and restricting international relations, restraining the development of Vietnam? Are these things true?\\n\\n \\n\\nThe truth is not so! It must be affirmed that the development and implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity is a major undertaking and policy of our Party and State in the new situation. Right in the Document of the 12th National Congress, our Party advocates: \"Actively struggle to defeat all plots and counter-actions of hostile forces; preventing and opposing false information and claims, repelling crimes and social evils; ready to respond to traditional and non-traditional security threats; ensuring security, information safety and network security”[2], especially in the context that “the international community has to deal more and more drastically with traditional and non-traditional security challenges, especially especially cyber security and new forms of warfare”[3]; Meanwhile, “Security, social order and safety in some areas are still complicated. Protecting state secrets is still weak. The work of ensuring safety, information security and network security is still inadequate”[4]. Therefore, the 5th session of the XIV National Assembly passed the Law on Cybersecurity to further institutionalize the 2013 Constitution and the Resolution of the 12th Party Congress to perfect the legal system on cybersecurity with all for the sake of The goal is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all citizens, for the stable development of Vietnam and in accordance with international law. Therefore, the above false claim is not only theoretically ambiguous, but also reactionary in practice.\\n\\n \\n\\nSecond, they think that the contents of the Cybersecurity Law are very vague and that no country has this law. According to the Vietnam Military Encyclopedia: “Security is a state of stability and safety, with no signs of threatening the existence and normal development of individuals, organizations, each field or of the world. the whole society… Maintaining comprehensive security is a condition for comprehensive development”[5]. Article 2, Clause 1 of the Law on Cybersecurity affirms: “Cybersecurity is the assurance that operations in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, rights and interests lawful organizations and individuals\". Thus, in terms of terminology - network security - in terms of its content, it has shown the necessity to issue and implement this law.\\n\\n \\n\\nTheir claim that “no country has this law”! This is yet another fabrication based on conceptual swapping. To date, 138 countries have had Cybersecurity laws including topical laws and regulatory provisions scattered among other laws, and many of those laws are much stricter than those of Vietnam. On December 7, 2015, parliamentarians and member states of the European Union (EU) reached an agreement on the first Cybersecurity Law applicable to the whole bloc: “According to the above law, service providers Online services such as: Google and Amazon will have to report any serious violations to national authorities or they will be fined. The new law, titled \"Information and Cybersecurity Guidelines,\" sets out strict security and reporting requirements for companies operating in key sectors, such as transportation, energy, and logistics. quality, health and finance. Companies operating on the Internet such as: Google, Amazon, eBay and Cisco will have to report serious violations to national authorities or face penalties.sanctions from these agencies”.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn Germany, the Ministry of Justice attaches great importance to cyber security. They give clear instructions to Facebook, if it is not well managed so that people can incite violence, curse online, and misrepresent it, they will be severely punished from Facebook managers to those who speak out. The Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (NetzDG) \\u200b\\u200bAct was passed in the middle of last year but officially took effect on January 1, 2018 after a 2-month extension for social network service providers to develop speech prevention tools. inciting hatred [7].\\n\\n \\n\\nOr in Korea, using social networks to launch insults at a certain \"idol\", you will soon receive a lawsuit from the famous character\\'s management company. Thus, the argument that \"the contents of the Cybersecurity Law are very vague and no country has this law\" is a fabrication, completely contrary to what is in fact.\\n\\n \\n\\nThird, they believe that foreign network companies will not provide user information at the request of the Vietnamese Government - playing \"own rules\". This is also a fabrication because every year, Facebook has a database report for the governments of the countries that are their markets. A total of 103 countries and territories, including Vietnam[8]. And after the Law on Cybersecurity was officially passed by the National Assembly, the Facebook representative in Vietnam said that Facebook\\'s activities were not affected in Vietnam. Moreover, Facebook is completing legal procedures to prepare to establish a representative office in Vietnam; help Facebook operate better, as well as coordinate better with the Vietnamese Government in the future. And so far, Google, Facebook and some other carriers still operate normally in Vietnam as well as not intends to withdraw from a potential market like Vietnam. Thus, the above argument is completely baseless.\\n\\n \\n\\n2. Raise vigilance, smash reactionary thoughts, provoke and cause trouble\\n\\n \\n\\nFirst of all, we need to continue explaining, propagating and clarifying the contents of the Cybersecurity Law so that all classes of people can understand and grasp it, and each citizen should raise their vigilance against insidious conspiracies and tricks. poison of hostile forces. Resolutely smash some extremists\\' claims to incite and cause trouble, take advantage of democracy to oppose good guidelines and policies of our Party and State, including the Law on Cybersecurity. . At the same time, raise awareness and actively implement a number of specific contents and tasks as follows:\\n\\n \\n\\nFirstly, among those who have little understanding of Vietnamese law and international public law, especially the Free Trade Agreements (AFTA) that Vietnam has signed with countries within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). World Trade Organization (WTO) or the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). However, so far, the world has never had a concept that considers cyberspace as a commodity, but only units of information transmitted and received in cyberspace are goods measured in Bytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes. , Tetabyte.v.v. The Vietnam Cybersecurity Law does not have any provisions on taxing import and export of information units, but only regulations on copyright protection for information content. And this regulation is consistent with the provisions of WTO, CPTPP on intellectual property.\\n\\n \\n\\nSecond, are those who are using cyberspace, even though they have not committed acts of infringement on network security, or have no acts of infringing upon national security and social order and safety, but are still afraid of being exposed. personal information, worried that carriers will withdraw from the Vietnamese market. To answer these concerns, they did not look to the official document of the Law on Cybersecurity just passed by the National Assembly, but instead received false information, distorted information, misrepresentation, even misinformation. even fabrications emanating from the media apparatus of forces hostile to Vietnam. Since then, they have had inappropriate reactions.\\n\\n \\n\\nThird, the forces hostile to Vietnam have fiercely opposed the passage of the Cybersecurity Law and are now fiercely opposed to bringing the Law on Cybersecurity to life. Because with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, from now on, hostile forces that oppose the State of Vietnam and go against the interests of the Vietnamese people are no longer allowed to act on their own in cyberspace. and the so-called \"freedom on the internet\" to spread information that is against the State of Vietnam, harmful to Vietnam\\'s national security and social order and safety. That is the real cause of the frenzied actions against Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis frenzy has been evident since the 5th session of the XIV National Assembly of Vietnam began to discuss and plan to pass the Law on Cybersecurity. The conspiracy of these forces is to take advantage of people\\'s ignorance of the law to deceive and rely on anti-Vietnamese forces abroad tofabricating and distorting the Law on Cybersecurity. Their ultimate purpose is to \"abolish Vietnam\\'s legal weapons\" so that they can blatantly infringe upon Vietnam\\'s sovereignty, independence, national security and social order in cyberspace, and grossly interfere. daring to enter Vietnam\\'s internal affairs...\\n\\n \\n\\nIn this anti-war campaign, the hostile forces not only through their henchmen in the country incited people to gather illegally and destroy the State\\'s property, but also provided spiritual support to the people who were living in the country. That serious violation of the law with content that is false, distorted, fabricated, slanderous, etc. In fact, many misrepresented and fabricated news and articles about Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law are published. published with a dense frequency of dozens of articles a day on BBC Vietnamese, VOA Vietnamese, Vietnamese RFA, etc., as well as the websites of the Viet Tan terrorist organization, of the so-called National Government provisional Vietnamese delegation in the US led by Dao Minh Quan. It is a fact that following the Vietnamese government\\'s declaration that Viet Tan and the Provisional National Government of Vietnam are two terrorist organizations, a number of websites of reactionary groups have been removed by the network owner. . Most recently, there is no need for Vietnamese law enforcement agencies to intervene, but only patriotic Vietnamese facebookers to report to the Facebook network operator about the act of spreading information inciting violence posted on websites. Facebook \"Viet Tan\" and \"Patriot Diary\", the owner of the social network Facebook has temporarily deleted these two pages...\\n\\n \\n\\nFourthly, in addition to those who oppose Vietnam politically and harm Vietnam\\'s national security, those who commit fraudulent acts to appropriate property, launder money, traffic in people, trade drugs, trading in banned goods... and other illegal acts on the internet can no longer self-manage, causing damage to consumers.\\n\\n \\n\\nSubjects who are unreasonably concerned about the Cybersecurity Law can use persuasion, education and explanation measures to make them understand properly. As for those who fiercely oppose the Law on Cybersecurity, it can be seen as acts against the affirmation of Vietnam\\'s rights, independence, national security and social order in cyberspace. Those are acts of treason. With the Law on Cybersecurity being passed and taking effect after half a year, Vietnam will surely have a standard legal corridor to protect its sovereignty, independence, national security and social order and safety. in cyberspace.'\n",

Therefore, individuals who abuse their positions and powers in law enforcement and cyberspace for their own gain, according to the provisions of the ANM Law, need to be severely dealt with. From there, it will create trust for people, affirm the fairness of the law as well as the necessity of the ANM Law in this 4.0 era.\\n\\nPreviously, we had a number of laws with regulations on ANM but not strictly. The introduction of the ANM Law helps the State clearly regulate the use of cyberspace, protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. However, in order for the Law on ANM to come into life, it is necessary to promote propaganda work among the people. In which, it is necessary to promote the propaganda role of local organizations. We must help people understand the ANM Law well, to get consensus as well as not to be taken advantage of by the bad guys, inciting opposition to the ANM Law. Currently, the Ward Veterans Association has implemented the basic contents of the ANM Law so that its members understand the meaning and importance of the ANM Law. Each officer and member should be an active propagandist, contributing to raising people\\'s understanding of the Law on Security'\n",

Notably, cybercriminals and cyber attacks are increasing in both scale and sophistication and complexity into the nation\\'s important information infrastructure. According to statistics from the Vietnam Computer Incident Response Center (VNCERT) under the Ministry of Information and Communications, in 2017, Vietnam\\'s internet was threatened by more than 10,000 cyberattacks, causing 12.3 losses. trillion. According to VNCERT, from the beginning of 2018 to May 2018, there were 4,035 incidents of cyberattacks entering Vietnam. Recently, VNCERT said that by the end of July 2018, this center had recorded many targeted attacks by hackers into the information systems of some banks and important national infrastructure in Vietnam. . To conduct attacks, hackers perform fraudulent tricks, combine high-tech measures to bypass information security protection systems to gain control of users\\' computers, through which attacks internal computer systems that contain important information. On July 26, 2018, BKAV announced that its virus monitoring system detected a type of spying malware called BrowserSpy. This is a very dangerous computer virus because it has the ability to spy on users, collect searches, read emails and web browsing history, steal personal information, Gmail, Facebook passwords, etc. Bank accounts… According to BKAV, so far more than 560,000 computers in Vietnam have been tracked by BrowserSpy malware, and the number is continuing to increase…\\n\\nThe above news events are also enough to clearly show that cyberattacks have become a type of crime causing national insecurity, economic losses and personal insecurity, becoming a global concern... Security e-government network?is just a risk or risk, but becoming a threat across borders, has been and is a problem that governments and individuals in countries have to face. And the fact also shows that today every field of social activity can always be the object of cyber attack. Cyberattacks not only target the economy, defense, technology, science, etc., but also issues of political opinion, social regime, culture, education, infrastructure, social security. , aviation management, traffic, ... are also the subject of cyber attacks. This requires that in order to protect national security, governments of countries must develop and issue legal documents not only to combat cyber attacks, but also to organize, manage, operate and handle activities. related to the internet, ensuring the safety and health of the society, and protecting citizens. That is the basis for explaining why the legal document on cyber security is a system related to all fields of social and human activities when using the internet, as Article 1 of the Law on Cybersecurity of Vietnam (effective in this regard). (effective from January 1, 2019) defines the scope of regulation: “This Law stipulates activities to protect national security and ensure social order and safety in cyberspace; responsibilities of relevant agencies, organizations and individuals”; and the concept of cyber security is specifically explained in Article 2: \"is the assurance that operations in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, legitimate rights and interests of of organizations and individuals”. In fact, Vietnam\\'s adoption of the Law on Cybersecurity is considered by a large number of experts and the Internet user community as a necessary move to help protect Vietnam\\'s sovereignty in cyberspace as well as ensure the safety of Internet users. users before the potential risks in today\\'s network environment...\\n\\nHowever, knowing that when the Law on Cybersecurity takes effect, their impure and evil activities are at risk of facing the law more directly, so hostile forces and some organizations , individuals with a lack of goodwill have loudly protested despite the interests in the field of social and human activities mentioned by the Law on Cybersecurity. These individuals and organizations only focus on one law related to their activities to conduct a campaign of denial, slander and distortion. (Unfortunately, some governments and international organizations also joined them, deliberately exerting pressure.) For example, commenting on RFI on June 12, 2018, a person known as a \"person, intellectual\" expressed his \"most concern\" that the Law on Cybersecurity \"swapped the concept... to silence his mouth.\" the people… do not benefit the country, but lead astray…”. That said, it proves that this \"person\" does not care about other important contents of the Cybersecurity Law, ignoring the issue that when the Law takes effect, the economy, culture, etc. of the country are protected. how to defend. At the same time, he himself changed the concept, used the trick to turn the part into the whole, so that from a law in the Law on Cybersecurity, it did not meet his will but denied the entire legal document. According to this person\\'s one-sided approach, Vietnam does not need to protect network security, bad guys are free to attack the country\\'s infrastructure system, attack banks to steal money, mess up the public relations. operating e-government, inciting violence, selling counterfeit goods, promoting terrorism, causing aviation accidents. All individuals using the Internet in Vietnam must therefore accept that they are always at risk of being stolen personal information, bank accounts, email, Facebook... are publicly or anonymously, impersonating to spread fake news, spread false statements, oppose the country, incite opposition, spread countercultural products to poison the young generation, attack the cultural foundation nationalization, etc. can self-edit on the internet without being punished. Regrettably, these kinds of statements have misled some people\\'s thoughts, to join their voices in protest and criticism. Although many people have never studied carefully and carefully about the Cybersecurity Law before, to realize that this law is one of the legal tools that directly protects the society they live in, and protects themselves and others. Dear.\\n\\nA civilized society is a society in which all citizens have a spirit and sense of respect for the law. In order for the country to stabilize and develop, along with the efforts of the government, all citizens, professions and organizations, the sense of law observance must be one of the factors that play a dominant role, ensuring basic principles that determine the safe and healthy development of society. If you deliberately go against or destroy those principles, it is irresponsible to society and people. At the same time, it must be affirmed that Vietnam is a sovereign country, no government, no organization or individual can give themselves the right to interfere with that immutable sovereignty. Therefore, those who are trying to find all ways to slander, fabricate or distort the call for \"disobeying the Cybersecurity Law\" should stop, do not make themselves subject to legal action.'\n",
      " \"Just owning an electronic device (smartphone, laptop) with an internet connection, individuals have the right to freely communicate their information and opinions to others anywhere, anytime. It is this convenience and utility that allows individuals to freely chat, transmit… all their problems, creative ideas, and thoughts on social networks (MXH).\\n\\nLawyer Cao Son Ha from the Provincial Bar Association said that individuals' freedom of expression in cyberspace under the 2018 Cybersecurity Law is broader than an individual's freedom of expression in the press (according to the Law on Press and Publication). 2016). Because, expressing personal opinions in the media (print press, picture press, electronic newspaper - this type must be licensed and registered to operate under a very strict regulation) is always approved by these agencies. to verify and verify the legitimacy, constitutionality, objective truth, by a fairly professional, highly qualified and professional department, then allow publication and take responsibility before the law for publishing jobs.\\n\\nMeanwhile, to own one or more personal accounts in cyberspace, the registration procedure is very simple. Individuals can post and share information even without verification. Therefore, the accuracy of personal information in cyberspace is not high.\\n\\nFor example, the Facebook account Lan Nguyen Van posted an article on the morning of 6-8 causing a stir about a person wearing clothes related to the field of burial and cremation carrying jars of lost ashes and delivering them in different areas. blockade epidemic prevention in Ho Chi Minh City. When the official press entered the verification, the matter was not quite as the article. There is practically no alley 42 Au Co as this Facebook post mentions. The urns mentioned in the article were delivered in many districts such as: Tan Binh, Tan Phu, 11, 6, not just P.Phu Trung, Tan Phu district as this account posted. The owner of this Facebook account also admitted to the press that he only saw and wrote according to his emotions…\\n\\n* Do not humiliate or slander others\\n\\nThe use of information by individuals in cyberspace to humiliate or slander others is strictly prohibited by law. Those who commit violations shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, be disciplined, administratively handled or examined for penal liability; if causing damage, they must compensate according to the provisions of law.\\n\\nTherefore, in Clause 3, Article 16 of the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity, it is very clear that information on cyberspace with humiliating and slanderous content includes: seriously insulting honor, reputation, the dignity of others. Fabricated or untrue information infringes upon honor, reputation and dignity or causes damage to the lawful rights and interests of other agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\nAccording to lawyer Cao Son Ha, freedom of speech does not mean that you like to express your views and opinions arbitrarily. Freedom of speech must be within the framework of the Constitution and laws. These limits are reflected in prohibited acts, administrative and criminal sanctions in the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity, the 2018 Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200bInformation Security, the 2015 Penal Code, the Civil Code 2015…\\n\\nSpecifically, the act of offending the dignity and reputation of others on Facebook is a violation of Point a, Clause 1, Article 101 of Decree 15/2020/ND-CP dated February 3, 2020 of the Government providing for sanctions. administrative violations in the field of post, telecommunications, radio frequencies, information technology and electronic transactions (effective from April 15, 2020). This behavior is subject to a fine of 10-20 million dong and forced to remove infringing information.\\n\\nRegarding criminal liability, acts of infringing upon the dignity and reputation of others may be handled according to Article 155 (crime of humiliating others) and Article 156 (crime of slander) of the 2015 Penal Code if the person give information from full 16 years old or older, have the capacity to take criminal responsibility. The use of social networks that seriously offend the dignity and honor or cause damage to the legitimate rights and interests of others is considered by the 2015 Penal Code as an aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility for the crime of humiliating people. other and may be imprisoned from 3 months to 2 years\"\n",
      " 'Along with that, the authorities have also developed and published documents of a warning nature, which is recently the Code of Conduct on social networks issued by the Ministry of Information and Communications to help all public people ensure the right to freedom of speech, at the same time, show a sense of responsibility, preserve fine customs and traditions, and contribute to the construction and defense of the Fatherland.\\n\\nFreedom of speech is one of the basic human rights. In Vietnam, Article 25 of the 2013 Constitution affirms that citizens have the right to freedom of expression and emphasizes that \"The exercise of these rights is prescribed by law\". That corresponds to the requirements set out in international documents that Vietnam has signed.\\n\\nFor example: Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (the Declaration) affirms that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion, freedom to express opinions, to seek, receive and impart information and opinions by any means. media regardless of national borders; At the same time, Article 29 of the Declaration affirms that in exercising this right, everyone must comply with such limitations as are established by law in order to ensure recognition and respect for the rights of others, and to meet justifiable ethical requirements. , public order, the general welfare in a democratic society.\\n\\nSimilarly, paragraph 2 of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights affirms that “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression”, while paragraph 3 of Article 19 emphasizes that the exercise of this right is accompanied by the obligation, special responsibility, subject to certain limitations as prescribed by law in order to respect the rights and reputation of others, protect national security or public order, health, morality...\\n\\nIn the context of the internet - emerging as a rapidly growing but very complex social network, in order for people\\'s right to freedom of speech to be strictly and comprehensively enforced, laws and sub-law documents on freedom of speech has been increasingly improved to both ensure the rights of citizens and help them to be exercised on the basis of the law.\\n\\nSpecifically: Law on Press, Law on Access to Information, Law on Cybersecurity, Penal Code (with Article 117 \"Crime of making, storing, distributing or propagating information, documents and items aimed at the State against the State, The Socialist Republic of Vietnam”, Article 155 “Criminal humiliation of others”, Article 156 “Slander”, Article 167 “Crime of infringing upon the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press and access to information…”, Article 331 \"Crime of abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals\"...), Law on Telecommunications (Article 12 \"Prohibited acts in telecommunications activities\" Communication\" has Clause 4 which is \"Distributing information that distorts, slanders, offends the reputation of organizations, honor and dignity of individuals\"), Civil Code (Article 32 on \"Individuals\\' rights to image\", Article 34 on \"The right to protection of honor, dignity and prestige\"...); Decree 72/2013/ND-CP on “Management, provision and use of Internet services and online information”, Decree 15/2020/ND-CP “Regulations on sanctioning of administrative violations in the field of postal, telecommunications, radio frequency, information technology and electronic transactions”… In response, in 2016, the Vietnam Journalists Association issued “10 articles of the Code of Professional Ethics for Journalists.” Vietnam\", until 2018, the Journalists Association continued to issue \"Rules for using social networks by Vietnamese journalists\".\\n\\nHowever, the reality also shows that, when the internet and social networks develop at a rapid pace, not only Vietnam but also other countries around the world have to face challenges from the complexity and difficulty of the internet. Control over information is derived from the view that freedom of expression on social networks is absolute, without limits. Judging from the relationship of nature - phenomenon, freedom - necessity, objective - subjectivity, in many cases, if challenges are not overcome, if challenges cannot be regulated, everyone can be offended. attack on social networks without having a chance to reclaim honor and justice. Even at the national level, there is a risk of falling into an information chaos - a factor that can cause disturbances in the human mind and social disorders.\\n\\nTherefore, not only Vietnam, but also countries around the world have taken resolute measures on the law, both recommending citizens to behave civilly on social networks, so that freedom of speech can operate actively and meet the needs of the people. meet the requirements of healthy development of society and people. Based on the choice of development direction, cultural traditions, specific conditions and contexts, etc., each country has built its own system of legal criteria for freedom of speech for its country.\\n\\nAs in Singapore, with the Law on Protection from Online Manipulation and Deception, fake news is considered to be against the interests and stability of the community, compromises public safety and security, and harms the public. harming health, inciting hatred among social groups, reducing trust in the functions and duties of state agencies, damaging relations between Singapore and other countries; If found to be spreading fake news on social media, when the authorities ask for correction and do not comply, they can be fined up to S$20,000 or jailed for 12 months (or both). Singapore also has a regulation on speakingdefamation, defamation, slander in daily life and on social media will result in a fine of up to S$100,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 years (or both); slander, defamation is punishable by a fine of up to S$20,000 or imprisonment for 12 months (or both).\\n\\nIn the United States, limits on freedom of speech are reflected in court precedents, which give the government the power to prevent and punish speech that is obscene, defamatory, obscene, offensive, or aggressive. The US Supreme Court has affirmed that freedom of speech does not mean the right to fabricate slander and defamation of individuals. In France, Germany, etc., the laws related to freedom of speech all set strict limits and sanctions for the abuse of freedom of speech that affects the legitimate rights and interests of others. and at the same time fight against slander, libel, racism, religion, incitement to violence, hatred, invasion of personal privacy... Expression of views on the internet is also governed by press law.\\n\\nThere are also many other punitive rules and regulations such as the Code of Practice for online social media platform providers in the UK; Code of Conduct on Social Media and Online Commenting in Australia... Not only each individual country, the European Union (EU) has also issued a Code of Conduct on the internet, Facebook, Twitter, Google has also assisted in establishing a Code of Conduct with a commitment to ensuring prompt access to, marking, and removal of hate speech and illegal content on their platforms. By 2020, the social network TikTok has also joined this Code of Conduct.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, although there are specific legal provisions, the authorities have repeatedly recommended, and many statements and violations are strictly handled, but recently the status of violations in statements Comments, news, mentions and discussions about organizations or other people on some social networks are on the increase, even quite complicated.\\n\\nWhile many Vietnamese people, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, education, region, etc., use social networks as a means of connecting with relatives and friends with similar interests to share and confide. , exchange, learn, help cultivate knowledge, spread and multiply the values \\u200b\\u200bof truth - goodness - beauty, etc., there are still many individuals who behave arbitrarily, without culture, even negatively on the internet. social networks, causing public opinion to be disgruntled and harshly voiced. It seems that these citizens mistakenly believe that social media is a place where freedom of speech has no limits, is not within the scope of national law, is not related to community cultural norms, so they behave regardless of the law, cultural norms? Then when the authorities warned and handled, they loudly said that the right to freedom of speech was violated, creating an excuse for the bad guys to take advantage of slander Vietnam!\\n\\nIn essence, when giving opinions, commenting, sharing content, etc. on a social network, an organization or individual has committed an act related to freedom of expression. Opinions, comments, shares, etc., whether positive or negative, cultural or counter-cultural, directly affect viewers and listeners. Thus, the above-mentioned acts are no longer within the limits of individuals, but are community activities, so they must comply with the limits permitted by law. Overcoming that limit, organizations and individuals will push themselves to the point of breaking the law, so they should be advised to self-regulate.\\n\\nTherefore, the Ministry of Information and Communications issued the Code of Conduct on social networks (the Code) with the following criteria: “respect, comply with the law; healthy; information security; responsibility” is necessary and appropriate. It should also be noted that although the criteria do not combine the requirements of reward and punishment, it is only a recommendation, but from the sense of responsibility of citizens as well as to the community, if everyone participating in social networks behaves according to The criteria of the Code will make an important contribution to building a safe and healthy cyber environment in Vietnam.'\n",
      " 'Sir, how does the Law on Cybersecurity affect people\\'s freedom of speech?\\n\\n+ First, it can be affirmed that the Law on Cybersecurity has absolutely no effect on people\\'s right to freedom of speech. There is no law that provides regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals using new network information like this. Never before has children\\'s rights been so protected on online information. The Law on Cybersecurity emphasizes the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations on network information. People are comfortable using the network to do activities that do not violate the law. There is absolutely no provision to impede free speech.\\n\\nOnly individuals who give false, fabricated, or insulting information according to 29 articles of the Penal Code will be handled. It is impossible to threaten to kill people online and be free, but in reality, they will be punished. It is impossible to freely buy and sell weapons, explosives, detailed instructions on how to use them, but in real life, they will be dealt with, but not on the internet… Who offends the nation, sovereignty, religion, or who discriminates against gender on the internet? …will be dealt with.\\n\\n-Is it mandatory for businesses to disclose personal information to security agencies in violation of personal privacy protection?\\n\\n+ Do not violate anything. Because there is article 17 of the Law already. Article 17 is very strict to protect the privacy of individuals and families. \"Enterprises when providing telecommunications services, internet and value-added services... are responsible for verifying information when users register for digital accounts, and keeping user\\'s account information confidential.\" Therefore, it is the responsibility of the business to maintain confidentiality. Failure to do so will be handled.\\n\\n\"Provide information to users in charge of network security protection upon written request to serve the investigation of violations of the law on network security\". In the event that the Law provides so, it will be provided. For example, when I see an online exchange of buying and selling explosives to prepare for terrorism, the involved party must definitely provide information for us to handle, otherwise a disaster will occur.\\n\\nIn addition, information will not be arbitrarily provided and must be treated as confidential. If you reveal that secret, you will be held responsible. Right now a lot of our information is being leaked.\\n\\n- But the sign of violation seems to be very vague, sir?\\n\\n+ No ambiguity. This issue is referred to in 29 articles of the Criminal Law. If we detect signs of a bomb, we have to arrest it immediately. Information must be requested to verify if the person is true or just fabricated information. And after that, we can handle the law or handle it in another form.\\n\\nAnd I believe that when formulating this, the National Assembly\\'s Committee on Defense and Security and the Law Committee of the National Assembly scrutinized it very carefully.\\n\\n-In the Law, there is a sentence that is quite vague. For example \"insulting great people\". So how to identify \"great man\", sir?\\n\\n+ This must be appraised by relevant functional ministries. If the Ministry replies that there is a violation, we will be handled. For example, related to credit fraud, it is necessary to ask the State Bank and financial economic groups to determine whether there is a violation. There are a lot of people losing money and this has to be verified by a cybersecurity agency. We have to step by step investigate, verify and clarify whether it is subjective, objective, age...\\n\\nOf course, no law is perfect. Someone asked me, \"Does this law prevent acts in cyberspace?\". I replied: \"Criminal Law is enacted, but murder is still there, robbery is still there\". Having a Cybersecurity Law is there to provide scope for what is protected and to know prohibited behavior for us to avoid. Even the agency in charge of cybersecurity must rely on this Law to know what is prohibited and what is allowed.\\n\\n \\n\\n-From now until the decree is formulated, will the editorial board continue to listen to people\\'s opinions, sir?\\n\\n+ The editorial board always listens, always adjusts, always asks for the right content to be submitted. All decrees are commented by agencies, economic groups, and internet telecommunications groups. I affirm so.\\n\\n-During the drafting of the Law on Cybersecurity, did we work with Google…?\\n\\n+ The draft Law on Cybersecurity was developed in November 2016 according to the Resolution of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister then issued a decision to establish a Drafting Committee. Members include many ministries and branches, not only the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Defense, etc. During the construction process, the drafting committee also followed Decree 72 on setting up servers and offices in Vietnam. Then, when submitting the Law on Cybersecurity at the 4th Session of the National Assembly, the National Assembly also asked how to adjust it to suit the recommendations of businesses and internet telecommunications corporations.\\n\\nDuring the drafting process, the drafting team also had the opportunity to approach major telecommunications corporations in the world such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, American Business Association, ASEAN.... Thereby to explain and listen to their opinions on the Security billour network.\\n\\nAfter the two sides worked and agreed, the representatives of those units agreed to adjust their strategies accordingly. The corporations themselves, these units also see our adjustments and regulations as appropriate. It is completely unlikely that Google and Facebook will withdraw from the Vietnamese market. And certainly with a market share like that of Vietnam, currently 48 million Facebook accounts and will certainly be larger, so there is no such thing as rumors. There is absolutely no information about this'\n",
      " 'Freedom of expression is one of the fundamental human rights enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 19, Universal Declaration human rights (UDHR) in 1948 states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression; including freedom to hold opinions without interference; as well as freedom to seek, receive and impart ideas and information through any media, and without frontiers”. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1966 also stipulates: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas, regardless of domain, orally, in writing, in print, or in the form of art, through any media of their choice”. It can be said that freedom of speech is an important basis for the full realization of other human rights and is associated with the right to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, association, freedom of thought, belief and religion. education, as well as the right to participate in the management of state and social affairs.\\n\\nHowever, along with the development of information technology in this day and age, the form of expression of free speech has undergone a great change. The Internet and social networks have become popular tools for all individuals and organizations to express their views and ideas, spread information, and express their right to freedom of expression. Its pervasiveness and influence are sometimes stronger and faster than traditional journalism and other forms of expression. This fact has raised many social and legal problems, including the management of information in cyberspace.\\n\\nLimits of freedom of expression in cyberspace\\n\\nFreedom of speech is a basic human right, but it must always be limited within the framework of the law. Article 19 of the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states: “The exercise of the right to freedom of expression may be subject to certain limitations and these should be provided for by law, in order to : a) Respect the rights or reputation of others; b) Protect national security or public order, health or morals of society”. Thus, freedom of speech is not absolute freedom. Under certain circumstances, freedom of expression may conflict with other legitimate values \\u200b\\u200bor rights.\\n\\nEspecially, in the context of the explosion of the internet and social networks, information becomes more complex and difficult to control. Through electronic information sites and social networks, users can freely express opinions, views, post or spread any information through their personal accounts without incurring any liability. which limit. Expressing one\\'s freedom of speech has never been so easy and so contagious. But this itself also brings risks when this right is abused, especially when those who post information on cyberspace have wrong views, extreme attitudes, inadequate legal awareness...\\n\\nLooking at the law enforcement practices of many countries around the world, it can be seen that there is no such thing as absolute freedom of speech. Each country, depending on specific conditions and contexts, imposes certain limits on the exercise of free speech by its citizens. In the United States, the limits of freedom of expression are shown mainly in the case law of the courts, especially the US Supreme Court, which allows the government to prevent and punish speech of a pornographic nature. , obscene, defamatory, offensive and aggressive, without being considered unconstitutional.\\n\\nIn France, the law on freedom of speech sets forth strict limits and sanctions to punish abuses of the right to freedom of expression that affect the legitimate rights and interests of others, including the protection of human dignity, against slander and libel; against racial and religious discrimination; against inciting violence and hatred (Law on Freedom of the Press, 1881); against invasion of privacy (Civil Code); Prohibit the publication of certain documents related to national security (Criminal Law). Expressing personal views on the internet is also governed by the Press Freedom Law.\\n\\nIn addition to France, many other European countries are also very strict in this regard in order to combat all forms of inciting propaganda, and to carry out criminal sanctions for hate speech and incitement. Italy, Spain, and Turkey also criminalize acts of defamation, insulting the honor of the president or members of the royal family. In addition, in a joint effort to prevent the abuse of free speech to make hateful and negative statements on the internet, the European Union (EU) has issued a Code of Conduct on the internet with commitment to combines the actions of four of the world\\'s largest network enterprises including Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Microsoft. These moves aim to \"ensure the people\\'s right to true freedom of expression and create the basis for building a truly democratic and civilized society.\"(first).\\n\\nMost recently, in the midst of a \"storm\" of fake news about the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of countries around the world have implemented many sanctions, from warnings, fines to jailing those who spread false rumors. true. In China, the act of spreading false information about the epidemic is punishable by fines, public surveillance or imprisonment from 3 to 7 years if causing serious consequences. In South Korea, President Moon Jae-in declared spreading fabricated information about the epidemic a \"serious offense\". Meanwhile, in Malaysia, the Government has arrested 6 people for posting false information about the Corona virus. Iranian police also arrested a person for posting a fake video, announcing a hospitalized COVID-19 patient on social networks. In the UK, a \"misinformation control unit\" has been set up to conduct the identification of COVID-19 fake news and liaise with media businesses to remove it.\\n\\nFighting against abuse of freedom of expression in cyberspace in Vietnam today\\n\\n\\nInternet and social network users, especially young people, need to improve their awareness and ability to self-screen information_Photo: Documentation\\nFreedom in general and freedom of speech in particular need to be understood as freedom within the framework of the law. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1953 European Convention on Human Rights, and the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights all affirm the right to freedom of expression, but also emphasize freedom of speech as freedom. within the limits of morality and law, mainly aimed at protecting the dignity and honor (private life) of others, protecting business secrets, preventing discrimination, discrimination, and inciting violence force, war, resisting criticism, criticizing the government, especially if they are calls for riots, threatening public order and national security. Therefore, each country can consider its actual situation to concretize the exercise of citizens\\' right to freedom of expression.\\n\\nObviously, in any political regime there can be no absolute freedom of speech, countries strictly handle acts of abusing freedom of speech; promoting freedom of speech must be for the common good, not the absolutization of individual freedom, not taking advantage of freedom of speech to write, speak, or distort with bad intentions, regardless of morality and law. France.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, the Party and State always respect and guarantee human rights, including citizens\\' right to freedom of expression. Freedom of speech is considered a constitutional right right in the first Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1946: “Vietnamese citizens have the following rights: freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of organization and assembly, freedom of belief, freedom of residence and movement in the country and abroad” (Article 10). The 2013 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam continues to affirm: “Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, access to information, assembly, association, and demonstration. The exercise of these rights is prescribed by law” (Article 25). Besides, we also have the Press Law 2016, the Law on Access to Information 2016. Our country\\'s legal framework on basic freedom of expression is adequate, synchronous and compatible with international law on human rights. Like other countries in the world, Vietnam has regulations to limit and prevent acts of abusing freedom of speech, infringing upon national interests, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations. , citizen.\\n\\nAware of the importance, benefits and dangers of the internet and social networks, our Party and State have adopted appropriate guidelines and policies to develop the internet and social networks; at the same time protect network security and prevent and fight against taking advantage of the internet and social networks to distort, oppose the government, and infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. Among them are Directive No. 28-CT/TW, dated September 16, 2013, of the Secretariat of the XI term, on \"Strengthening the work of ensuring network information security\"; Decree No. 72/2013/ND-CP, dated July 15, 2013, of the Government, on “Management, provision and use of internet services and online information”; Directive No. 15/CT-TTg, dated June 17, 2014, of the Prime Minister, on \"Strengthening the work of ensuring network information security and safety in the new situation\". The document of the 12th Party Congress clearly states: \"Focusing on the management of various types of information on the internet to orient the people\\'s ideology and aesthetics, especially for young people and teenagers\". In addition, during the implementation of Resolution No. 35-NQ/TW, dated January 22, 2018, of the Politburo, on \"Strengthening the protection of the Party\\'s ideological foundation and fighting against false views contrary, hostile in the new situation\", the Central Propaganda Department has strengthened the direction of the work of fighting and countering false information and claims, conspiracy, and activities taking advantage of the internet and social networks to fight back. destroy the Party and State. The Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Public Security proactively detect, fight, prevent and strictly handle those who take advantage of the internet and social networks to violate the law. The Cyber \\u200b\\u200bCommand (Ministry of National Defense) was established under Decision No. 1198/QD-TTg, ony August 15, 2017, by the Prime Minister, plays a pivotal role in ensuring national cyber security and safety, fighting against high-tech crime and \"peaceful evolution\" in cyberspace.

Some people do not have enough information, lack of understanding, so they easily believe and make opposing statements, hindering the implementation of the Law. The Dong Tam incident on January 9, 2020 caused shock and division in the community because of too many conflicting news streams on social networks. Enemy forces also take this opportunity to propagate against the regime...\\n\\nThe phenomenon of spreading fake and false information online also causes many consequences. For example, while the State is making efforts to prevent, control and repel the COVID-19 epidemic, there are those who take advantage of the epidemic situation to propagate false information, distort the Party\\'s policies and guidelines, State policies cause confusion in public opinion. They fabricated a false picture of the epidemic situation in Vietnam, spread fake news, made up stories about the number of infected people, the number of deaths, and announced that the rate of disease spread was many times higher than that of the Government. government announced, creating fear for the community, disturbing social life, causing doubts and conflicts between the people, the Party and the State. Through baseless information, hostile forces deliberately ignored the important results we have achieved, downplaying the Party\\'s leadership role, the State\\'s management capacity in handling the epidemic, slandered the State for concealing information, failing to prevent the epidemic from the beginning… Not only that, many subjects also intentionally spread false information about the epidemic situation in order to gain illicit profits. It is negative information that makes people afraid, rushing to buy masks, hoarding food, leading to the situation of \"stashing\" goods, \"blowing\" prices... Such acts cannot be used \"freely\". speech” to defend.\\n\\nWhen we prevent the above misinformation and misinformation, hostile forces claim that this is \"a form of information censorship\", \"violating the right to freedom of speech\". The truth is, the above prevention is necessary, in accordance with the law, all countries in the world must do it. After the Ministry of Information and Communications promoted exchange and working activities with representatives of Facebook, Google proposed to prevent, process and remove information that violates Vietnamese law on social networks, thousands of videos, including those with content inciting against the Party and State, have been removed from Youtube; Thousands of links with illegal content, hundreds of fake accounts, propaganda against the Party and State have also been blocked by Facebook...\\n\\nIn order to fight against abuse of freedom of expression in cyberspace, it is necessary to implement synchronously the following solutions:\\n\\nFirstly, education and propaganda to raise the responsibility of network users and the spirit of vigilance against rumors. Raising awareness and self-screening capacity of people and communities, forming positive behavior habits in the online environment. This is a key and long-term solution for each citizen to become an effective information filter for themselves and the community.\\n\\nSecondly, regularly monitoring, surveying, evaluating, promptly adjusting, supplementing and perfecting the legal system, mechanisms and policies to help effective management while being consistent with the rules governing administrative culture in social and community activities, while keeping up with the development of social networks.\\n\\nThird, it is necessary to strengthen technical measures. Specifically, adequate investment in agencies responsible for ensuring national cyber security and safety. Recruit and train a team of experts who are good at information technology, capable of effectively implementing technical and professional measures. At the same time, to encourage the development of Vietnam\\'s social network; coordinate with major foreign social network service providers, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Youtube to promptly prevent, handle and eliminate risks affecting social safety and national security. family.'\n",

This is a necessary activity, belonging to the responsibility, not related to business activities.\\n\\nPoint b, Clause 2, Article 21 stipulates that telecommunications, Internet, information technology enterprises, service providers on telecommunications networks, the internet, and added services in cyberspace are responsible for coordinating with The Ministry of Public Security in preventing, detecting and handling dangerous situations in cyber security.\\n\\nA dangerous cyber security situation is an event that occurs in cyberspace when there is a serious act of infringing upon national security, causing particularly serious harm to social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests. laws of agencies, organizations and individuals. Therefore, when a dangerous cyber security situation occurs, businesses are responsible for coordinating handling.\\n\\nArticle 26 stipulates that domestic and foreign enterprises, when providing services on telecommunications networks, the internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam, have the responsibility to coordinate with specialized forces to protect network security. in network information security.\\n\\nClause 2, Article 29, stipulates the responsibilities of domestic and foreign enterprises when providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace in handling information that is harmful to children. in cyberspace.\\n\\nArticle 41 stipulates the responsibilities of enterprises providing services in cyberspace in preventing and handling cyberattacks; warn of the possibility of network insecurity and coordinate and create conditions for the specialized network to protect network security in network security protection activities.\\n\\nThus, of the seven regulations related to the responsibilities of service providers in cyberspace, none of them are related to their business activities, start-up activities, import and export. exporting and manufacturing equipment of enterprises. Except for coordinating with the network security protection force to handle illegal acts in cyberspace and a number of responsibilities specified in Article 41 related to warning, remedy, handling violations of the law, enterprises do not have to fulfill any other obligations for their business activities.\\n\\nFacing some distorting propaganda opinions, leading the public to believe that the Law on Cybersecurity will hinder business activities of enterprises, Lieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan (Director of the Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity Department, Ministry of Public Security) ) affirms that this law contains no provisions governing the establishment of a business, start-up, investment, purchase, sale, or business of an enterprise; The law also does not require businesses providing services in cyberspace to have a sublicense to operate.\\n\\nCreate a healthy business environment\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity is widely considered to be the legal basis for creating a very level playing field. Not only that, many representatives of telecommunications and network service businesses also said that businesses and customers in Vietnam will benefit when the Law on Cybersecurity is promulgated.\\n\\nDiscussing this issue, Mr. Nguyen Hoa Binh, President of NextTech Group, said that since the Internet was present in Vietnam, there have been many cases of interference and cyberattacks on State agencies and businesses. by domestic and foreign \"hackers\". With such acts, the current law lacks legal corridors. The introduction of the Law on Cybersecurity helps to handle acts of intrusion and cyberattack, besides Mr. Binh said that Vietnamese enterprisesm will benefit from this legal corridor.\\n\\n\"There is currently no law regulating domestic and foreign enterprises for many years, creating injustice. For example, foreign enterprises doing business in Vietnam generate a lot of revenue, but are not headquartered in Vietnam. , do not create jobs for domestic workers, do not bring in tax revenue and are less subject to the management of the authorities, meanwhile, domestic enterprises directly create jobs and jobs for people. labor, is under the strict management of the authorities,\" analyzed the President of NextTech Group. Therefore, first of all, the Law will contribute to creating a healthy competitive environment between domestic and foreign enterprises in cyberspace. \"Accordingly, how domestic enterprises are managed, foreign enterprises must also be managed in the same way,\" Mr. Binh said.\\n\\nIn addition, for domestic internet service businesses, when internet data is stored in Vietnam, the cost of transmission lines will be reduced. For domestic businesses operating in commerce and advertising on the internet through Facebook, Google, Youtube..., foreign businesses will have to share tax obligations.\\n\\nAccording to Mr. Le Dang Phong, Network Exploitation Department of VNPT-Net Network Infrastructure Corporation, with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, domestic customers will benefit when domestic and foreign businesses will develop, upgrade technical infrastructure; diversifying types as well as improving the quality of services in cyberspace.'\n",
      " 'Continuing the program of the session on the morning of November 23, the National Assembly deputies discussed in the hall the draft Law on Cybersecurity. The necessity of promulgating the Law on Cybersecurity is a content analyzed and commented on by many National Assembly deputies at the discussion session.\\n\\nAccording to the report, the Law on Cybersecurity was born to meet the requirements of cybersecurity work in protecting national security and ensuring social order and safety; preventing and responding to threats to network security; overcome existing and limitations related to network security protection; fully and promptly institutionalize the Party\\'s guidelines and guidelines on cybersecurity; ensure conformity with the provisions of the 2013 Constitution on human rights, basic rights of citizens and defense of the Fatherland, and with international practices.\\n\\nVerification of the draft Law, the National Assembly\\'s Committee on National Defense and Security approved the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity to protect national security, and at the same time demonstrated Vietnam\\'s responsibility in cooperating in solving cases. using cyberspace to terrorize and sabotage world security and peace.\\n\\nThrough the discussion, many delegates agreed with the need for a Law on Cybersecurity because in the current situation, cybersecurity is a matter of global concern, having a strong and comprehensive impact on various fields. of social life. Many countries promulgate laws, introduce policies to develop information technology, improve capacity to prevent, defend, prevent and attack in cyberspace to protect values, interests, security of the country. In our country, hostile forces, some types of criminals, and some other objects have been using cyberspace to commit acts of sabotage, profiteering or infringing upon, threatening to infringe upon the nation. defense, national security, social order and safety, property of the State, agencies, organizations and individuals, especially in the condition that the information technology infrastructure system is not synchronized. management still has many loopholes, the policy system is not synchronized.\\n\\nAgreeing with the need for this law, delegate Trieu Tuan Hai (Lang Son) analyzed that Vietnam is currently in the group of countries with the most cyberattacks. Hostile forces and criminals thoroughly take advantage of the internet\\'s utility, especially social networks, to conduct activities to infringe on security and order, causing instability in society. Vietnam has no legal documents on cyber security; Existing regulations on cyberinformation security are not enough to deter and prevent violations in cyberspace. Delegates expressed the view that the development and promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is very necessary and suitable for the world, thereby effectively contributing to solving difficulties and obstacles in the implementation of network security as well as prevention and combat against activities using the internet to infringe upon national security, social order and safety.\\n\\nAsking the question, why there is a Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bInformation Security but still have to develop a Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bSecurity, delegate Nguyen Huu Cau (Nghe An) analyzed that the scope of regulation of the two laws is completely different. Citing the Penal Code, which regulates all crimes, the Law on Anti-corruption or the Law on Drug Prevention and Control prescribes measures to prevent and fight more intensively with the types of crimes that the state sees. More dangerous, it is necessary to prioritize prevention and control, delegate Nguyen Huu Cau argued: The Law on Cyberinformation Security protects information security on the three most common attributes, that is, the integrity of information; confidentiality of information; availability of information. The draft Law on Cybersecurity focuses on combating malicious information, infringing upon national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations in the network environment. Affirming that this is the fundamental difference between the Law on Cyberinformation Security and the Law on Cybersecurity, delegate Nguyen Huu Cau found that it is normal to have more specialized laws on the network environment. The US, China, UK... already have a Law on Cybersecurity that the Drafting Board consulted when developing this law.\\n\\nDebating again with delegate Nguyen Huu Cau, delegate Nguyen Lan Hieu (An Giang) assessed that the cybersecurity protection measures in the draft Law on Cybersecurity have many similarities with the Law on Cyberinformation Security. . Delegate Nguyen Lan Hieu suggested that the National Assembly should complete and supplement existing laws, strengthen the management of social networks in the Civil Code, the Penal Code, and the Law on Access to Information to prevent fake news. ... In order to ensure a democratic development environment but still ensure national security, it is necessary to consider carefully and carefully before promulgating a law regulating this very sensitive field, the delegate suggested.\\n\\nWith the same view, delegate Nguyen Thi Kim Thuy (Da Nang) said that the reasons given by the Drafting Committee included: Meeting the requirements of cybersecurity work in protecting national security, ensuring order and security. all society; preventing and responding to threats to network security; overcome the existence and limitations related to network security protection toTo explain the need to enact the Law is not convincing. Delegates analyze the network as just a means and a space where acts of violating national security can take place. If it is said that there should be a separate law on cyber security, security in many other fields such as aviation security, food security ... must also be regulated by separate laws. \"As for the field of network information protection, this has been stipulated in the Law on Cyberinformation Security,\" the delegate stated.\\n\\nFor the reasons that the Law on Cybersecurity was born to fully and promptly institutionalize the Party\\'s guidelines and guidelines on cybersecurity; ensure conformity with the provisions of the 2013 Constitution on human rights, fundamental rights of citizens and defense of the Fatherland; To ensure conformity with international practices, delegate Thuy said that in fact the provisions on this issue in Chapter 2 of the draft Law on Cybersecurity are just concretization and guidance on the implementation of regulations on security and privacy. Network information security assurance is specified in Chapter 2 of the Law on Cyberinformation Security. These specific contents are specified in Chapter 4, Decree 85 of the Government on responsibility to ensure information system security.\\n\\nThe draft Law was first submitted to the National Assembly for consideration at this session. Through the comments of the National Assembly deputies, Minister of Public Security To Lam spoke, explained and clarified some of the issues raised by the delegates at the discussion session, thereby completing the draft Law submitted to the National Assembly.

In addition, the Law on Cybersecurity also stipulates that if a person performing an official duty on network security abuses his/her power or infringes upon the rights of individuals or organizations, they will also be severely handled.\\n\\n\"So there is certainly no abuse of power here,\" emphasized Lieutenant General Thuan.\\n\\nLieutenant General Thuan added that the Law on Cybersecurity clearly stipulates that only in the case of serving the investigation and handling of violations of the law on network security, the network security protection force has the right to request request for user information. Currently, there is a lot of information on the internet that the Law on Cybersecurity requires businesses to provide all user information such as personal information and private information to the authorities is incorrect.\\n\\nNo \"sub-license\" is generated\\n\\nDirector of the Cybersecurity Department Hoang Phuoc Thuan affirmed that there is no provision in the Law on Cybersecurity that requires businesses providing services in cyberspace to have a sublicense to be allowed to operate.\\n\\n\"Certainly, the cybersecurity agency will not issue any sub-licenses arising after the Cybersecurity Law takes effect,\" Lieutenant General Thuan affirmed and added, except for coordinating with the specialized force to handle the situation. violations of the law in cyberspace and a number of responsibilities specified in Article 41 related to warning, remedial and handling of illegal acts, enterprises are not required to comply with the law. any other obligations for its business.\\n\\nThere is no provision in the Law on Cybersecurity that regulates enterprise establishment, start-up, investment, purchase and sale, and business activities.'\n",

Online working software is searched and downloaded wildly. Many units are forced to open the system to the Internet so that employees can access and work remotely… This creates an environment for bad guys to exploit vulnerabilities, attack, and steal information.\\n\\nIn the past year, a series of large-scale cyber attacks took place globally, typically the Foxconn factory was attacked by hackers, demanding $ 34 million in data ransom; or 267 million Facebook user information for sale; Intel was attacked by hackers, causing 20GB of confidential data to leak...\\n\\nAccording to Bkav\\'s observations, in Vietnam, many large e-commerce sites, some online delivery platforms with many users, have been hacked and data stolen.\\n\\nWhen working remotely, organizations and businesses need to establish a secure connection environment by equipping solutions such as SSL, VPN, etc. to evaluate system security, evaluate software before publishing it to the internet; install anti-virus software, firewall, monitoring system... regularly update operating system patches; equipped with strong user authentication methods such as digital signatures.\\n\\nIndividual users need to be on high alert when working remotely; ensure a safe connection environment by installing anti-virus software; do not download and install software of unknown origin; regularly update software and operating system patches; Do not share or access unknown links.\\n\\nBank transaction attack\\n\\nIn 2020 alone, there are many cases of hackers taking over banking-related cyber security attacks, in which mainly the cases of stealing users\\' transaction OTP codes. The main method of hackers is to trick users into installing spyware on their phones to steal OTP messages and make illegal transactions.\\n\\nOn average, Bkav\\'s virus monitoring system has detected more than 15,000 spyware on mobile phones every month.

Bad guys will collect this data for the purpose of profiteering and fraud.\\n\\nSupply chain attack\\n\\nThe \"supply chain\" attack aka Suppy Chain Attack is becoming a prominent trend. Instead of targeting the victim directly, hackers attack the software manufacturers used by the victim, injecting malicious code into the software right out of the factory. Once the victim downloads or updates the software to a new version from the manufacturer, the malicious code will be activated, the hacker can easily successfully infiltrate the strictly protected systems.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, at the end of December 2020, Bkav\\'s network security monitoring system also recorded a similar attack aimed at infiltrating important agencies and organizations.\\n\\nAs a precaution, software vendors need to develop and implement secure product development and delivery processes; equipped with solutions to protect and monitor the system to detect abnormal behavior.\\n\\nExplosion of stealth malware W32.Fileless\\n\\nA form of targeted attack using stealth malware has broken out in 2020.

In addition, the Cybersecurity Law still ensures the freedom of speech of citizens, does not hinder internet and social network users.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity consists of 7 chapters and 43 articles. Clause 3, Article 4 of the Law clearly stipulates: To closely combine the task of protecting network security and protecting information systems important for national security with the task of socio-economic development, ensuring the right of people, citizens\\' rights, creating conditions for agencies, organizations and individuals to operate in cyberspace.\\n\\nSome Internet users, especially young people, expressed concern at the information that, when the Cybersecurity Law takes effect, popular services on the Internet such as Facebook and Google will be blocked, not allowed to be accessed. used in Vietnam. There is also concern that personal information and freedom of expression on social networking sites will be affected. However, this is absolutely not true, on the contrary, the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law also protect users against bad information and malicious information.\\n\\nIn addition, the Law on Cybersecurity also prohibits the use of cyberspace to commit acts against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, infringing upon the rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals; prescribe sanctions for handling violations of the law on network security.\\n\\nIn fact, in our country, many users of social networking sites are too \"easy\", if not \"light-hearted\" for information shared and distributed on social networks.

      " 'According to the previous revision,\" this year, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) once again made biased, unobjective and completely baseless assessments when classifying Vietnam as a country \"with less freedom of the press.\"\\n\\nThe content of RSF\\'s assessment is not only nothing new, still repeating the old thinking of previous years, but also shows that this organization has deliberately ignored the reality of ensuring freedom of speech and freedom. press in Vietnam.\\n\\nIt must be affirmed that the State of Vietnam always pays attention to protecting and promoting basic human rights, including the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to access information. This is specified in the Constitution and related legal documents, and is implemented in the actual political, economic and social life of Vietnam.\\n\\nEnsuring all citizens have the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press within the framework of the law is the consistent policy of the Party and State of Vietnam. For many years, the State of Vietnam has always strived to perfect the legal system in order to create conditions for promoting and protecting citizens\\' basic rights to freedom of expression.\\n\\nThe 2013 Constitution clearly states that “Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and access to information…The implementation of these provisions is prescribed by law.”\\n\\nThe 2016 revised Press Law and the 2016 Law on Access to Information also clearly state the State\\'s responsibility in creating favorable conditions for citizens to exercise freedom of the press and freedom of expression in the press; ensuring that all citizens are equal and not discriminated against in exercising the right to access information; ensure the provision of accurate, complete, timely, transparent and convenient information for citizens.\\n\\nArticle 11 of the 2016 revised Press Law clearly states that citizens have the right to: “Speak out on the situation of the country and the world; participate in the formulation and implementation of guidelines, guidelines and policies of the Party and laws of the State; comments, criticisms, recommendations, complaints and denunciations in the press for organizations and individuals.\"\\n\\nObviously, the 2016 revised Press Law and the 2016 Law on Access to Information are legally compatible with international documents on human rights, freedom of expression, and freedom of the press. Regrettably, RSF deliberately did not know the legal documents that have been put into practice for many years in Vietnam.\\n\\nFreedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of information in Vietnam are also clearly demonstrated through the diverse development of types and richness of content of the Vietnamese press.\\n\\nCurrently, Vietnam has about 41,000 employees engaged in journalism, 779 press agencies (including 142 newspapers, 612 magazines, 25 independent electronic press agencies), 72 agencies licensed to operate radio and television with a total of 87 radio channels and 193 television channels.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the waves of major international media agencies such as CNN, BBC, TV5, NHK, DW, Australia Network, KBS, Bloomberg... are easily accessible in Vietnam.\\n\\nOver the years, the press in Vietnam has demonstrated the right to freedom of expression and the right to information. The press has made important contributions to the construction of socialism and national defense; always actively fight against false and negative manifestations in society, contributing an important voice to promoting the strength of the great national unity bloc, consolidating and perfecting socialist democracy. , and is also an important bridge with international friends.\\n\\nThrough the press, the people also have a forum to express their thoughts, feelings and aspirations for the Party and State, and at the same time criticize and propose enthusiastic opinions to the Party and State.\\n\\n[Vietnam always supports and ensures the exercise of press freedom]\\n\\nAn undeniable fact about ensuring freedom of information and freedom of the press in Vietnam is the international media, when it comes to the \"secrets\" to help Vietnam effectively control the outbreaks. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the element \"transparent and clear information\" has been repeatedly mentioned.\\n\\nPress agencies are provided with timely and complete information about infections as well as measures that the government is taking to prevent the disease.\\n\\nMany foreign newspapers also highly appreciate the effective use of social media and information technology by the Vietnamese Government to update the epidemic situation and advise the people to comply with the regulations. epidemic prevention measures.\\n\\nJournalist David Hutt specializing in Southeast Asian politics also affirmed that when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, the Vietnamese Party and State were very transparent and open in sharing and updating data on the COVID-19 situation. -19. That is one of the reasons why Vietnamese people put their trust in the government\\'s anti-epidemic measures.\\n\\nRSF has also deliberately ignored the fact that Vietnam is recorded as one of the countries with the highest Internet growth and usage rates in the world with more than 68 million Internet users (accounting for 70% of the population).\\n\\nInformation technology and social networks have beenwidely used in daily life in Vietnam, allowing people to access information and express their views and opinions.\\n\\nIn the administrative apparatus from central to local levels in Vietnam, more and more agencies and organizations use social networks to work, handle administrative procedures, keep in touch with the people, capture and promptly settle the legitimate thoughts and aspirations of the people.\\n\\nThe exercise of the right to freedom of the Internet and social networks is always placed within the legal framework, thereby ensuring network security, preventing and stopping activities that take advantage of social networks to violate Vietnamese law in order to provoke, divide society, create excuses for outside forces to interfere in our country.\\n\\nThe 2016 revised Press Law also states: “Press and journalists operate within the legal framework and are protected by the State; No organization or individual may restrict or obstruct the press and journalists from operating. No one must abuse the right to freedom of the press, the right to freedom of expression in the press to infringe upon the interests of the State, the collective and the citizens.\"\\n\\nIn Vietnam, no one is tried or arrested just for expressing opinions or protecting human rights. Only those who take advantage of freedom of speech and press freedom to infringe upon the interests of the State, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals, violate the law; Distributing fake news, \"bad news\" in order to destabilize the country\\'s situation, cause political insecurity, social order and safety, and confuse public opinion... will be handled according to law.\\n\\nThis is also a measure of the State of Vietnam to protect people against fabricated, untrue information, inciting hatred..., which means ensuring the right to access accurate information for the public. people. That is consistent with international law and the laws of many countries.\\n\\nIn fact, it is not only in Vietnam that there are some sanctions against acts of abusing freedom of speech and freedom of the press to violate the law, but also in many countries such as the US, Germany, France, and South Korea. , Singapore, ... all have laws and provisions that strictly handle such acts.\\n\\nObviously, the realistic picture of guaranteeing freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Vietnam is an objective reality that no one can deny. RSF has deliberately denied the efforts of the Party and State of Vietnam in ensuring and respecting the people\\'s right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press and access to information, making false assessments. and very illogical.\\n\\nRSF\\'s allegations show that this organization is using tricks to distort and distort the truth about the press freedom situation in Vietnam with bad intentions. It is RSF that is going against the principle of journalists to respect and not be allowed to distort or distort the truth'\n",
      " 'Distortion and ridiculousness about the situation of democracy and human rights in Vietnam\\n\\nThe distorted and ridiculous view that politicize all issues is easy to see in the counter tactics of hostile forces about the democracy and human rights situation in Vietnam. They compulsively insert the moral element into legal terminology, typically the word they often chant: “prisoner of conscience”, reflecting eclectic, fallacious, unethical thinking in the absence of it. legal basis. Because, in the judicial system of Vietnam and other countries around the world, there is no term \"prisoner of conscience\". In fact, the so-called \"prisoner of conscience\" is just a trick to promote, support, and easily interfere in the protection and incitement of objects to oppose and distort policies, guidelines and policies. books of our Party and State. Public and strict trials of opposing subjects, such as: Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Pham Chi Thanh, Can Thi Theu, Pham Thi Doan Trang, ... are the necessary work of a family. sovereign state, in order to prevent illegal acts that are dangerous to society. Before justice, these subjects openly accepted the verdict of the trial panel with their crimes. However, a number of foreign organizations that have no goodwill towards Vietnam have issued statements criticizing the Vietnamese Courts and expressed their support and encouragement for those who have been tried and publicly judged on their conduct. commit crime. This is actually a very wrong legal approach and blatantly misrepresents the human rights situation in Vietnam.\\n\\nThey also argued that: Vietnam considers human rights with too broad a connotation, favoring social norms, and disregarding the guarantee of specific natural rights of individuals. They deliberately ignore an obvious fact that the guarantee of the specific natural rights of individuals must be placed in relation to the interests of society within the framework of the law. Not only in Vietnam, but most countries in the world approach and practice universal human rights not in general and abstract, but in the natural relationship between specific individual rights and rights of social groups. association directly related to that individual. Just based on some unverified and politically hostile information towards Vietnam to describe the situation of democracy and human rights would be a ridiculous view. This is most evident in the global human rights reports from 2013 by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\\n\\nEnemy forces in the name of universal human rights try to promote Western human rights. They consider themselves Western culture as the center, consider Western human rights to govern universal human rights around the world and higher than national sovereignty. This way in the name is dominated by the operating funds of individuals and civil organizations under the market mechanism, which seriously violates the international conventions and principles on the prohibition of interference in the internal affairs of the countries. Other countries. Typically, HRW\\'s reports on human rights are often reacted and criticized by many countries.\\n\\nEach country, territory and culture due to differences in historical circumstances, traditional values, development levels, political regimes, etc., should have a different approach to universal human rights. . Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the late Prime Minister of Singapore, once asserted: nowhere in the world are these rights allowed to be exercised without limitations, because blind application of these ideas can lead can go towards the destruction of organized society. Former US Ambassador to Vietnam Pete Peterson said that it is impossible to assess a country\\'s human rights situation on the standard of 100% satisfaction. The United States, like no other country, can meet that need; a 100% human rights satisfaction score is not possible in one country.\\n\\nOver the years, ensuring human rights in Vietnam has been appreciated and appreciated by many international leaders, politicians, observers and tourists. Journalist specializing in Southeast Asian politics, David Hutt told BBC News that the Communist Party of Vietnam acted responsibly and put the people first. In addition, Vietnam\\'s success in turning risks into threats has resulted in dual goals in: prevention and control of the Covid-19 pandemic; at the same time, socio-economic development, aiming to \"leave no one behind\" has received many good comments and evaluations from politicians, experts and international media. It is a living proof of the Party and State\\'s respect, protection and promotion of human rights.\\n\\nVietnam does not have freedom of speech and suppresses social networks - Distorted, ridiculous claims\\n\\nEnemy, reactionary, and politically opposed forces try to advertise and distort Vietnam to prevent freedom of speech and expression of opinions, and are enemies of the freedom of the press online. They criticized the government for arbitrarily arresting and prosecuting dissidents; censor, close websites, make criminal laws; the government tightens and restricts the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association, peaceful groups, freedom of movement and freedom of rent.teacher, etc. They misunderstand about the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press, leading to the belief that these rights are absolute, in order to provoke, boycott and retaliate fiercely, including smearing and opposing the social system. especially through \"dirty\" livestream on social networks, etc. Since then, promoting the establishment of a number of organizations in the name of literature and journalism, such as: \"Independent Literature\", \"Independent Journalists Association\", \"Reporters Without Borders\", \"The 88 Project\"1 ... to oppose the regime, distort the State, arrest and imprison independent journalists, fight for the so-called freedom of speech. Giving a misleading ranking of press freedom in Vietnam; pressuring for the release of those arrested by the authorities for violating Vietnamese law, which they call the arrest and imprisonment of \"independent journalists\", \"bloggers\", etc. These are distorting and ridiculous claims, because: Respecting, protecting and promoting human rights, including the right to freedom of speech, and freedom of the press are the consistent and consistent views of the Party and State. our country. With a view to upholding the role of the press as a forum for the people, as a bridge between the Party, the State and the people, for the people to present their thoughts, feelings and aspirations. Through it, the press performs the function of social criticism, proposes enthusiastic opinions to the Party and State, and guides public opinion in the process of building the Party\\'s guidelines, policies, and laws. of the State, contributing to promoting economic, cultural and social development, ensuring national defense, security, social order and safety. Implementing that view, the State of Vietnam pays special attention to building and perfecting the legal system to ensure freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of information. The right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to access information are regulated by the Constitution (2013), the Press Law (2016) and the Law on Access to Information (2016) stipulating the responsibility of the State, create favorable conditions for citizens to exercise their rights to freedom of the press and freedom of speech; ensuring that all citizens are equal and not discriminated against in exercising the right to access information; ensure the provision of accurate, complete, timely, transparent and convenient information for citizens. In particular, newspapers are not censored before printing, transmission and broadcasting.\\n\\nCurrently, Vietnam has about 41,000 employees working in the field of journalism, with 779 press agencies (including: 142 newspapers, 612 magazines, 25 independent electronic press agencies), 72 agencies The agency is licensed to operate radio and television with a total of 87 radio channels and 193 television channels. As of June 2021, the number of internet users is nearly 70 million, an increase of 0.8% in the period 2020 - 2021 (accounting for more than 70% of the population); the number of people using social networks is nearly 76 million people, an increase of nearly 10 million people within 1 year (equivalent to 73.7% of the population). Vietnam is rated as the country with the 12th highest number of internet users worldwide and sixth out of 35 countries/regions in Asia.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of information is not an absolute right but a limited right. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of information are considered fundamental principles for a democracy, even as \"oxygen\" in a democratic and developed society; but not recognized by the international community as an absolute right. International documents on human rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 (Article 29), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 (Article 19) all confirm: exercising the right to freedom of expression comes with special obligations and responsibilities, which may be subject to certain limitations set forth in law and are necessary to respect the rights or reputations of others; protect national security or public order, the health or morals of society. The laws of most countries in the world limit this right, such as: in the US, the Penal Code (Article 2.385, Chapter 115) provides for restrictions on the right to freedom of expression; In Germany, the Cybersecurity Law 2015 (amended in 2018), stipulates that social networking services can be fined up to 50 million euros if there is a case of users insulting, causing hatred, or spreading the word. spreading fake news, etc.\\n\\nIn order to approach international human rights standards, Vietnam has developed and perfected the legal framework to guarantee the right to freedom of expression, the principle that the press and journalists operate within the legal framework. protected by law; strictly prohibit all acts of abusing press freedom and freedom of expression in the press to infringe upon the interests of the State, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and citizens. All acts of violating the law shall be handled by competent state agencies in accordance with the order and procedures prescribed by law, ensuring publicity, transparency, right people, right crimes, right laws, and not wronging people. innocent and not guilty. Simultaneously, monitor, survey, evaluate and promptly adjust, supplement and perfect the legal system and policies in line with the rules governing cultural behavior in daily life.social community, especially in cyberspace. The above fact has exposed the one-sidedness and distortion of freedom of speech in Vietnam.'\n",
      " 'Elements of political opportunism and hostile forces have made false accusations that: \"Vietnam has deprived the people of their right to freedom of expression and freedom of information\"; “serious violation of press freedom”… These are very reactionary statements aimed at jamming information, slandering, blatantly distorting the freedom of information and press of Vietnamese citizens.\\n\\nIn fact, in Vietnam there is no \"expropriation\" at all.

Currently, our country is in the top 20 countries with the highest number of internet users in the world, with nearly 70% of users, much higher than the world average (more than 51%). Through electronic information sites and social networks, people can freely express their opinions, views, post or spread any information through their personal accounts such as Facebook, YouTube, Viber, Zalo… The expression of each person\\'s freedom of speech has never been so easy and contagious as it is today. The people can contribute ideas to draft documents submitted to Party congresses, comment on draft laws, regimes and policies, etc. However, the State of Vietnam also resolutely punishes. organizations and individuals take advantage of this issue to commit acts of spreading bad news, distorting, smearing, raiding, forming factions against the Party, State and the socialist regime in our country.\\n\\nDistorting the situation of freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Vietnam is an old trick and trick, but now it has been adjusted very subtly and cunningly, always being used by extremist organizations and individuals. frequently used political opportunities.\\n\\nIn the face of blatant misrepresentation of political opportunistic elements, hostile forces, party committees and authorities at all levels, it is necessary to do a good job of propaganda to raise people\\'s awareness and responsibility in using on the internet, equip themselves with the skills of self-screening information, fostering the formation of positive and cultural habits of action and behavior in the online environment. Further strengthen the Party\\'s leadership over press activities and ensure the right to information of all citizens before the law.

They are concerned because they misunderstand that the Cybersecurity Law limits their personal freedom in cyberspace, while in fact the Law regulates prohibited behaviors that Facebook users often commit such as false information. truth, causing confusion among the people, causing damage to socio-economic activities, causing difficulties for the operation of state agencies or official duty performers; giving false information, fabricating, insulting human dignity, etc., according to 29 articles of the Penal Code, they will be handled. Clause 1 - Article 17 stipulates that users of social networks are not allowed to do: \"Put on cyberspace information of personal secrets, family secrets, and private life contrary to the law.\" . The Law on Cybersecurity emphasizes the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations on network information; there are no provisions to impede freedom of speech. In fact, over the past time, many false information has spread at a dizzying speed on social networks, greatly affecting socio-economic activities, causing bad public opinion among the people. A lot of false information but spread quickly is because a part of people, especially young people, are only interested in sharing \"hot\" information to attract the attention of friends. but rarely understand the true nature of that information. In addition, they do not understand the consequences of sharing false information, how harmful information will affect the security situation, politics, economy, society ... of the country. Therefore, the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is extremely necessary, meeting the inevitable requirements of state management while still being consistent with the reality of social life; at the same time creating a legal basis for international integration. Research shows that, in just the past 6 years, 23 countries around the world have promulgated over 40 legal documents on cybersecurity, such as the US, Japan, UK, Germany, France, etc. The Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Czech Republic, China, Korea... The formulation and promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity will ensure that our country\\'s cybersecurity work has a certain conformity with international practices and ensure the conditions for international integration on network security.\\n\\nThus, in general, the provisions of the Law on Cybersecurity are necessary and follow the general trend in the world on legal regulations to ensure network security; meet practical requirements to proactively prevent, detect, prevent and handle acts of infringing upon network security, ensuring that activities in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, order and safety. society, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals; especially, do not hinder the freedom of the internet, the healthy freedom of speech and the protection of the law of the Vietnamese people.\\n\\nHowever, in order to prevent misrepresentation and misunderstanding, to distort the positive meaning of the Cybersecurity Law, to avoid abuse and to help better awareness and compliance with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, all levels , branches, the Fatherland Front and socio-political organizations and unions, especially schools, information and communication agencies, newspapers and publishing houses, need to strengthen propaganda and dissemination of content, The meaning and role of LThe Cybersecurity Law has reached a wide range of people in many far-reaching ways in order to help officials, party members, union members, members, students, and people of all strata be fully aware of the importance of the law. the importance and necessity of the Law on Cybersecurity, contributing to gradually bringing the Law on Cybersecurity to life.\\n\\nThe advent of the internet and social networks has posed new challenges, humanity has to face a complex information system such as: Information difficult to verify, false information, malicious information about morality, lifestyle, and mental abuse against people. For individuals, the internet and social networks are tools that bad guys can use to spread false information in order to cheat to appropriate property, terrorize the spirit, threaten to post private information online. … For the state, the internet and social networks are powerful weapons that hostile forces and reactionaries at home and abroad have been, are and will be taking advantage of more and more thoroughly for propaganda and distorting activities in the future. , against the regime. After carrying out many activities to put pressure, but still could not prevent the National Assembly from passing the Law on Cybersecurity, especially when the Government announced to collect opinions on the Draft Decree on implementing the Law on Cybersecurity, the following positions could not be stopped. The more hostile and reactionary forces are, the more aggressively they use many tricks to create a wave of protests, obstruct the implementation and demand the abolition of this Law. They spread on social networks, claiming that the Law on Cybersecurity \"especially infringes on private space\", \"violats freedom of speech, press, internet\", \"violates human rights\". Many Western news agencies, newspapers and many websites with servers located abroad intentionally distort and obstruct the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law. A series of reactionary organizations and individuals at home and abroad have set up websites and blogs, and used many facebook accounts to mold and mix real and fake information, cut pictures, spread rumors, and attract attention. reader\\'s curiosity. In particular, during the time of important political events of the country, bad elements through facebook, zalo, youtube... posted and shared a lot of distorted information to lash out, satirize, cross sculpting events taking place throughout the country; smearing, fabricating, and discrediting the image of comrades leading the Party and State, leaders of agencies in the government system, causing skepticism among the people, and dividing the great national unity bloc. The hostile and reactionary forces have chosen social networks as a new \"front\", with full of cunning and sinister tricks to strengthen their resistance against our state. And it is reprehensible, when some people, because of ignorance, intentionally or unintentionally abet hostile and reactionary forces. It can be said that there has never been a time when hostile and reactionary forces had a methodical and detailed plan to distort and eliminate any law like the Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe negative reaction to the Cybersecurity Law of hostile forces, political opportunists, anti-regime and our State is also understandable, because for them, this is a legal tool. deprive them of important weapons that they can use to accomplish their goals of subverting, overthrowing, and transforming our regime into an alien \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" path. For the State and our people, the promulgation and strict implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity is one of the important guarantees and an effective measure to ensure human rights, legitimate rights and interests of citizens. This is a legal weapon to prevent and handle abuses and abuses, protect national security, and maintain social order and safety. Therefore, each citizen needs to be alert, properly identify, to eliminate false, hostile and distorting views about the Cybersecurity Law, and ensure that the Law on Cybersecurity is effectively implemented. To do so, you must learn about the Law on Cybersecurity (maybe on Google) so that you do not violate or be taken advantage of by others to commit bad acts. In particular, do not abuse social networks to post, share, like, comment on websites, articles of unknown origin, false information that confuses public opinion and complicates the situation. In the case of detecting that someone has posted content that distorts, opposes the state, or spreads false rumors on social networks, people should immediately notify the agency, local government, police agency. where the incident occurred in order to take timely measures.\\n\\nEvery cadre, civil servant and public employee should be aware of the plots and tricks to spread false and reactionary information of individuals and organizations that intend to destroy our Party and State so as not to be linked by them. , inciting or enticing to participate in illegal activities. Each social network user must protect themselves against the negatives, recognize the duality of social networks, avoid inadvertently abetting anti-destructive activities, negative, objectionable behaviors, unethical behavior on social media. In particular, people need to be very careful when accessing information posted from unofficial, fake, foreign-origin sites, or by reactionary individuals, elements, or organizations. yesanti-Vietnamese activities (some websites and facebook accounts of typical enemies and reactionaries such as: RFA - Radio Free Asia; BBC News Vietnamese, VOA Vietnamese, facebook VOATiengViet, Youtobe VOATiengViet ; Fanpages: Viet Tan, Catholic Youth, Good News for the Poor, Patriotic Diary, Club of Free Journalists, New Horizons Media, Brotherhood for Democracy, Hoang Sa FC, Portrait of Rights page force, newspaper officer, facebook Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (ie, Mother Mushroom), Hoang Ngoc Dieu, Le Cong Dinh, Nguyen Huy Vu, ...). When accessing negative information on social networks, actively search for official press and information sites to compare and contrast. If the source, motive and purpose of the information and the person sharing the information cannot be identified, it is necessary to stay calm and careful not to comment or spread information. In addition, it is necessary to build a positive attitude to always seek and share good and useful information, limit reading negative, malicious and unknown information. Everyone needs to know how to take advantage and use social networks properly and effectively, turn social networks into a means and a useful channel to expand knowledge, together build a social network culture environment. a healthy society, avoid being influenced by virtual information, effectively contribute to preventing and stopping wrong and hostile thoughts and views.'\n",
      " 'From the activities of the Clean Newspaper group, it is necessary to study and identify tricks to take advantage of the right to freedom of speech to infringe upon the interests of the State and oppose the government. And propose effective solutions to fight and strictly handle this dangerous crime.\\n\\nViolations of the law of the \"Clean Newspaper\" group\\n\\nIn May 2021, the Investigation Security Agency of Can Tho City Police transferred the file to the People\\'s Procuracy of the same level to propose the prosecution of defendants Truong Chau Huu Danh, Nguyen Thanh Nha (SN 1980), Doan Kien Giang (SN 1986). , living in Ho Chi Minh City) and Nguyen Phuoc Trung Bao (born in 1982, living in Da Nang) about abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations. individual.\\n\\nDuring the settlement of the case, on July 6, the Can Tho City Investigation Security Agency prosecuted the accused and banned Le The Thang from leaving the residence (SN 1982, living in Hanoi City). ) investigating acts of abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\n121-1626417107.jpg\\n The defendants (from top to bottom, from left): \\u2008Truong Chau Huu Danh, Nguyen Thanh Nha, Nguyen Phuoc Trung Bao and Doan Kien Giang.\\nThese are all members of the \"Clean Newspaper\" group - an organization that writes and publishes many articles and video clips on \"hot\" topics of public interest and posted on social networks such as the Ho Duy case. Hai, Western drought, land dispute in Dong Tam article about Truong Ton Duc Thang, issue of export ban during the Covid-19 epidemic, coercion at Gia Trang Quan (Ho Chi Minh City).... Many articles, posted on the personal accounts of the defendants are hidden under the name of \"clean journalism\", but the essence of the articles is to orient public opinion in a negative direction.\\n\\nParticularly for defendant Truong Chau Huu Danh, the Investigation Security Agency collected 31 articles related to Can Tho City and 29 videos posted publicly on Facebook, defendant Danh admitted that the articles reflected were false. real. In addition to using personal Facebook to commit crimes in Can Tho, defendant Danh along with defendants Bao, Nha and Giang took advantage of press freedoms to write and post on the \"Clean Newspaper\" Fanpage. and Group “Cleaning Newspapers”. Many Fanpage articles \"Clean newspaper\" and Grourp \"Clean newspaper\" - established by the accused, have untrue content, lack of verification, and are subjective inference.\\n\\nHiding under the name of a group of people who dare to \"frankly\" share about \"hot\" issues of public opinion, but the nature of the articles posted by the target group contains unfounded comments and fallacious words. , misrepresented with bad intentions. The trick used by the subjects was mainly to attribute the incident based on emotional inference, lack of objective evidence...\\n\\nSo what is the purpose behind the guise of free speech of this target group?\\n\\nClean newspaper is not the first organization to be prosecuted for abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State. Like the previous common motif of many political opportunistic, domestic and international forces, they took the name of \"democracy, human rights\", freedom of speech, and freedom of the press to transform information patchy and dishonest information aimed at slandering, fabricating, and lowering the role, position and prestige of the Party and State. The depth of these acts is to form and gather forces to oppose and overthrow the government.\\n\\nIdentify countermeasures\\n\\nPolitical opportunistic groups such as \"Clean Newspaper\" determined that they must \"infiltrate\" the ideology and politics of cadres, party members and the masses in order to achieve results. Therefore, the main tricks used by the subjects to propagate against the Party and State are through images, articles, video clips on social networking sites (Facebook, Youtube, BBC Vietnamese.com...) with a motif. , like:\\n\\nimage002-1626417144.jpg\\nRecently, there have been many acts of abusing freedom of speech to distort and oppose the Party and State in cyberspace with increasingly sophisticated and dangerous tricks.\\nFirstly, they exploit and use information in the press reflecting negative issues, bureaucracy, corruption, evils in society... to publish in the direction of one-way information, in order to influence the reader\\'s mind.\\n\\nIn fact, no State is absolutely perfect, because the State is an organization formed and developed by people, so is the State. This model will still have shortcomings such as corrupt bureaucracy, moral degradation of a few leading cadres… However, that does not mean that a few \"worms\" are equated with common shortcomings. of a political system. History and current reality have proven that: the leadership of our Party and the operation of the State apparatus have led the country to overcome the great storms of the times. Along with that, the Party and State always strive to build a society that is fair, democratic and civilized and puts people at the center of all development efforts.\\n\\nSecond, political opportunistic forces have focused on exploiting information aboutg shortcomings, limitations, and failures of the Party and State in the fields of economy, culture, society, security and defense.... At the same time, the forces tried to take advantage of the shortcomings of a part of cadres and party members who were degraded, corrupt, and negative and were disciplined to raise the individual phenomenon to its essence, blacken the regime, and deny it. fully accept the efforts and achievements of the whole political system.\\n\\nWith seemingly \"objective and frank\" words, but in fact political opportunists want to conspire to lead public opinion to disparage and deny the core role of the government apparatus. Then gather into cyber \"protests\", more serious can turn into real-life riots.\\n\\nThird, not only do they speak out to distort and slander the regime, they also entice and incite individuals who intend or reveal their intentions to oppose and discontent with the State into a collective force. , organizations through social networking sites. The enticing and seduction is done with promises, financial backing (mainly) or \"self-titled\" by \"titles\" in associations, groups or organizations.\\n\\nThus, it can be seen that associations, groups and organizations like Clean Newspaper have \"vindicated\" the guise of \"democracy\" as a \"breakthrough\" in the strategy of \"peaceful evolution\" to oppose the regime. Behind all the \"reform\" rhetoric is the demand to implement the multi-party system, deny the leadership role, and move towards removing the Communist Party from the development process of the nation. This is a very malicious, sinister and blatant scheme of political opportunistic forces.\\n\\nRegulations of international and Vietnamese law\\n\\nInternational law stipulates that human rights in cyberspace are human rights and fundamental freedoms in terms of political, civil, economic, social and cultural expression in cyberspace. According to the fundamental principle of international human rights law: everyone has the right to freedom of expression without interference. The common feature of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of field, orally, in writing, in print or in the form of art, through any media of their choice”.\\n\\nTherefore, in the current context, the right to free expression of information takes place not only in the form of direct language and actions, but also in indirect forms through cyberspace, this form of expression. are still recognized by international law.\\n\\nHowever, freedom of expression in cyberspace is not an absolute right. If absolute freedom means freedom of anarchy, wild freedom, everyone speaks, speaks indiscriminately, distorts the truth, fabricates, shares unverified information, regardless of right or wrong. will lead to loss of control, cause social disorder, information disturbance, may create a social information crisis, leading to instability in security and social order.\\n\\nAccording to the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the ICCPR, the right to freedom of expression may be subject to certain restrictions in order to respect the rights and freedoms of others, public health or social morals, for reasons of public safety and security. national security or public order; These restrictions must be provided for in national legislation.\\n\\nIn Europe, most countries are influenced by the doctrine that it is easy for people to abuse their rights to enjoy, such abuse is easy to harm others, so freedom must be limit. From that point of view, the European Union (including 28 countries) allows member countries to consider the interests of each country to make specific regulations to guide citizens to exercise their freedoms. speech. That is the right to freedom of expression must be within the principle of ensuring \"national security, territorial integrity, maintenance of public order and the prevention of crime, protection of health and morality, dignity or honor.\" human rights, prevent the spread of classified information, and ensure the power and independence of judicial authorities\".\\nIn 1982, Vietnam joined the ICCPR and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the legal values \\u200b\\u200bof human rights in the International Human Rights Law, including human rights. freedom of information, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of speech and expression of opinions.\\n\\nUp to the present time, on the basis of ensuring the right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Vietnam has been continuously improved. As of December 31, 2020, the country had 779 press agencies and 21,132 journalists. On the other hand, Vietnam is currently the top country in terms of the percentage of citizens participating in social networks, with more than 70% of citizens across different regions, regions and social groups. At the same time, according to the law, no person or group of citizens is prohibited or restricted from participating in social networks and expressing their right to freedom of expression.\\n\\nFreedoms nFreedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of publication, and freedom of assembly were stipulated right from the 1946 Constitution, reaffirmed in later Constitutions. Up to the 2013 Constitution and current governing documents such as the Press Law 2016, the Law on Access to Information 2016, the Cybersecurity Law 2018, the right to freedom of expression is recognized as follows: Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, access to information, assembly, association, demonstration. The exercise of these rights is provided for by law. The State creates favorable conditions for people with disabilities, people living in border areas, islands, mountainous areas and areas with extremely difficult socio-economic conditions to exercise their right to access information...\\n\\nThe views of the Vietnamese Party and State on the exercise of human freedoms, including freedom of speech of citizens are very clear, transparent, scientific and humane. The State always takes care of well implementing the basic freedoms of people and citizens, but it must be accompanied by discipline, discipline and law.\\n\\nimage003-1626417216.jpg\\n \\nFor acts of taking advantage to damage the honor and dignity of others, harming the interests of the nation or nation, they must be severely punished according to law. The Press Law 2016, the Law on Access to Information 2016 and the Law on Cybersecurity in 2018 both clearly stipulate the limits of freedom of expression in cyberspace, such as: acts such as posting, broadcasting, etc. spreading false information, distorting, defaming, denying the government; fabricating, causing confusion among the people; distort history; denying revolutionary achievements; offend the nation, national hero; Untrue information, slander, insult to the reputation of agencies and organizations, honor and dignity of individuals ... are handled by law.\\n\\nArticle 4 (Clause 3) of the 2018 Cybersecurity Law defines: “Strictly combine the task of protecting network security and protecting information systems important to national security with the task of socio-economic development. society, ensuring human rights and citizens\\' rights, and creating conditions for organizations and individuals to operate in cyberspace. This principle is an important legal basis for the establishment of a mechanism to harmonize regulations that limit rights with the guarantee of rights and freedoms in cyberspace.\\nLooking at the provisions of international and domestic laws, it can be seen that the act of publishing false articles by the \"Clean Newspaper\" group has violated the limit of freedom of expression on the Internet. cyberspace. These are slanderous, libelous, fabricated information that infringe upon national security and social order, denying the government. This information has affected the proper functioning of the judiciary, the leadership of the Party and the operation of the State apparatus.\\n\\nIn fact, this is not a new trick of the criminal, many organizations have used it with a similar motif before, but the results of the \"Book\" target group are still achieved to a certain extent. That is the number of users who are interested in, commenting, and sharing posts on social networks. Even the Facebook account (before it was locked) of the accused Truong Chau Huu Danh, the number of followers has reached tens of thousands of people, which is not a small number. Also according to the conclusion of the investigation, since 2011, the accused Truong Chau Huu Danh directly registered and used the Facebook account of the same name for the purpose of writing articles and posting clips for social criticism.\\n\\nSome solutions to fight and prevent\\n\\nIn the coming time, along with the development of the industrial revolution 4.0, many applications and utilities will continue to appear to meet the increasing needs of people\\'s lives, in which the presence and development of the Internet will continue to grow. society is necessarily objective but also contains many potential risks of non-traditional security. Therefore, in order to fight and prevent tricks from abusing freedom of speech to infringe upon the interests of the State, immediate solutions are needed as follows:\\n\\nFirstly, Party committees and authorities at all levels need to step up propaganda and education to raise political awareness and vigilance for cadres, party members and people against propaganda activities against the Party and the people. Government. This is a very important solution for each citizen to uphold their responsibilities and raise their vigilance against all plots and tricks of \"peaceful evolution\" of hostile forces.\\n\\nSecond, continue to improve institutions and policies, review the \"gaps\", the \"gaps\" for the formation, arising and existence of negatives.\\n\\nThird, step up the fight against corruption and negativity from the central to local levels, avoid the situation of \"above hot, under cold\", strengthen people\\'s confidence in the leadership of the Party and management of the Party. Government. This is an important issue in order to create a consensus between the State and the people, to create a united strength to refute all divisive claims from the dissident elements.\\n\\nFourthly, synchronously develop solutions for propaganda on the mass media and in cyberspace, contributing to identifying and proactively fighting in a timely and effective manner against all attack and sabotage tricks of the enemy.hostile forces. Press agencies need to proactively identify and fight scientifically and effectively against the plots, tricks and counter-actions of hostile forces.'\n",
      " 'Many organizations and individuals voiced their responses in the name of international and non-governmental organizations, but this digital identity is not difficult to recognize. For example, Freedom House said that \"Vietnam continues to be an enemy of Internet freedom\" when it comes to the Law on Cybersecurity, giving many \"stormy\" views. So who is Freedom House, see the background to know the \"familiarity\".\\n\\nFreedom House (ie \"free house\") is a non-governmental organization, established in October 1941, headquartered in the United States. The organization assigns itself the mission of \"monitoring the process of global democratization, surveying and studying the implementation of political and civil liberties in countries around the world\".\\n\\nFreedom House also claims to be “a transparent voice for democracy and freedom in the world”! To demonstrate its mission, every year Freedom House publishes documents called reports on freedom in the world, annual reports on press freedom and Internet freedom. Worth mentioning, out of more than 200 countries and territories around the world, Freedom House chooses its own list to survey.\\n\\n\\nMany people took to the streets to gather and cause trouble due to the impact\\n\\nfrom provocative information on social networks.\\n\\nMany times, in its report on \"world freedom\", \"freedom of the press\", \"internet freedom\", Freedom House continues to consider Vietnam as a \"non-free\" country in the exercise of political freedom. administrative and civil.\\n\\nSince its inception, Freedom House has been a propaganda machine created by the late President Roosevelt to prepare the American public for America\\'s entry into the war in World War II. However, after the end of the second world war, Freedom House was not dissolved, but continued to be used to conduct propaganda campaigns, advocate for the Marshall Plan and NATO, and propagate propaganda. against Communism.\\n\\nIt is a fact that until now, most of Freedom House\\'s operating funds are funded by the US Government, so it has become a tool of those who have spent money to operate under the guise of research, monitoring, promote freedom, democracy, human rights...\\n\\nTherefore, the information that Freedom House gives about Internet freedom is imposed by bad ideas and intentions. Recently, Freedom House\\'s 2017 Internet Freedom report in the United States said that Vietnam continues to \"sink deeper into the group of countries without Internet freedom\". They ranked Vietnam 7th, after China, Cuba... and depicted on the map with gray bars, indicating that the country has not changed in terms of Internet freedom.\\n\\nThe way Freedom House does it is similar to Human Rights Watch (HRW), which is to turn yes into no, no into yes, using lies to slander. Like Freedom House, every year HRW repeats its misrepresentation, accusing Vietnam of suppressing the right to freedom of speech, association, freedom of the press, and the Internet.\\n\\nThe characters that HRW cited for so-called \"repression of human rights\" also echo the list that Freedom House uses if the number of \"democrats and human rights activists\" is active in anti-social media channels. spread on the Internet. Supporting and accompanying Freedom House, HRW, there are many websites, newspapers, magazines, radio stations and press organizations such as Southeast Asia Press Alliance (Seapa), Reporters Without Borders Organization Reporters sans frontières (RSF)...\\n\\nIn their annual reports and reports, these organizations make false statements and assessments that the Vietnamese State violates freedom of the press, the Internet, suppresses the press, suppresses bloggers, and then deliberately ranks Vietnam Nam is on the list of countries with extremely low rankings in terms of freedom of the press, speech, and Internet... HRW, Freedom House cites cases of imprisonment and criminal punishment when taking advantage of the internet to commit crimes. offense.\\n\\nThe annual \"Press Freedom Index\" report of Reporters Without Borders said that freedom of the press and the Internet in Vietnam \"has not shown any signs of improvement\", people \"are not allowed to freely due to access to information” and Vietnam has become “the world’s second largest prisoner of bloggers and netizens”. Similar to the guise of Freedom House, together with the publication of the report, RSF took advantage of a number of media outlets that lack sympathy for Vietnam and are hostile to Vietnam to give interviews \"to deepen the understanding of Vietnam.\" than” this report.\\n\\nBorn in 1985 in France, from the very beginning, RSF gave itself the right to promote freedom of the press and freedom of expression in the Western style. RSF is a name with no face that often distorts and distorts the situation of press freedom in Vietnam. Their way of doing things is also like no other, it is based on denunciations or articles of law-breaking objects and then chained and put on a list of condemnation of violations of freedom of the press, internet, and speech.\\n\\nIn fact, RSF operates not in the interests of journalists, who have been denounced in many countries. This organization is also accused of receiving a lot of support from American billionaire George Soros, who has supported the Solidarnosc union with millions of dollars, from the National Endowment for Democracy - an organization. 90% of the budget comes from the national budget of the US and belongs to the Ministry of FinanceAmerican diplomacy”.\\n\\nBecause of such financial dependence, RSF, Freedom House, HRW... all have the same motive and purpose of action. Therefore, until the next appointment, their reports and reports list dozens and hundreds of countries and territories around the world to evaluate \"in their own way\", thereby criticizing, only to the governments of the countries.\\n\\nTherefore, it is not surprising that when the National Assembly passed the bill, RSF immediately called for \"revoking the Cybersecurity Law\". Daniel Bastard, head of RSF\\'s Asia-Pacific office, said: \"We ask Vietnamese lawmakers to revoke this harsh new law, which has been instrumental in strengthening control. government for access to information”. “We also ask online service companies not to give in to the unacceptable threats posed by this law” he threatened!\\n\\nObviously, the truth of those of RSF, Freedom House, HRW... has been revealed for a long time, the same guise, tricks of fraud, deception and slander as before, although today\\'s trend has changed a lot.\\n\\nAlong with such organizations, many individuals at home and abroad also have the opportunity to \"condemn\" the issue of cybersecurity, criticize the National Assembly and the State of Vietnam. It can be clearly seen that those who commit illegal acts, taking advantage of cyberspace to destroy the country, have been handled by the authorities in various forms.\\n\\nThis number has long used the Internet to write defamatory propaganda articles, in the name of \"civil society\", \"democracy and human rights\", \"defense of the Fatherland\"... to form associations and groups with the name. Calls, slogans, principles, and purposes are easy to impress with the needs and tastes of certain classes and social sectors such as \"Civil Society Forum\", \"Prisoners of Conscience Association\", \"Association of Prisoners of Conscience\". Association of Women for Human Rights\", \"Association for Mutual Friendship\", \"Association of Independent Journalists\"...\\n\\nTheir tricks are through websites, online forums, especially social networks to openly organize, propagate, deceive, entice people to participate, and use security software to communicate. , organize online training and training for the number of members, openly write petitions, demand the establishment of an opposition political party, request the establishment of an association or group, and demand lawsuits, slander, and misrepresentation of the State. We violate international treaties on civil rights…\\n\\nObjects take advantage of loopholes in the law, negative issues, democracy, human rights, ethnicity and religion in the country to propagate, distort and plot to form and publicize organizations political opposition in Vietnam. Others are now following this thought and point of view, promoting and defending illegal acts of what they call \"dissidents\" such as: Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, Nguyen Van Hai, Nguyen Van Dai, Dinh Nguyen Kha, Nguyen Phuong Uyen, Ta Phong Tan, Dinh Nhat Uy, Truong Minh Tam, Chu Manh Son...\\n\\nWith cyber security, a regulating law, directly affecting cyberspace - where the forces, organizations and individuals as cited above use as effective tools against Vietnam are like leeches. right lime, they react violently.\\n\\nThe problem is that we - the people who live and protect this regime, this country and this people must understand it properly, know the difference between right and wrong. But if you keep seeing people talking online, swearing online, saying that this law is nothing, this law covers the regime, pulls back history, this law strengthens dictatorship, is totalitarian... I don\\'t know if the crab\\'s head is narrow, so it\\'s dangerous to join in.\\n\\nSeen as it is, the current joining in like the wind in bamboo houses on facebook, blogs, and online forums is scary. How many people have read the bill, then when the National Assembly passed it, they saw every word in the law and saw the Internet swearing, they also joined in cursing, then shared articles, clips, mocking graphics everywhere, as if I enjoy something very good, but I don\\'t know that it is a help to sow disaster, but first of all, it is in myself before talking about the disaster in people, the disaster for society and the country.'\n",

But this itself also brings risks when this right is abused, especially when those who post information on cyberspace have wrong views, extreme attitudes, inadequate legal awareness...\\n\\nLooking at the law enforcement practices of many countries around the world, it can be seen that there is no such thing as absolute freedom of speech. Each country, depending on specific conditions and contexts, imposes certain limits on the exercise of free speech by its citizens. In the United States, the limits of freedom of expression are shown mainly in the case law of the courts, especially the US Supreme Court, which allows the government to prevent and punish speech of a pornographic nature. , obscene, defamatory, offensive and aggressive, without being considered unconstitutional.\\n\\nIn France, the law on freedom of speech sets forth strict limits and sanctions to punish abuses of the right to freedom of expression that affect the legitimate rights and interests of others, including the protection of human dignity, against slander and libel; against racial and religious discrimination; against inciting violence and hatred (Law on Freedom of the Press, 1881); against invasion of privacy (Civil Code); Prohibit the publication of certain documents related to national security (Criminal Law). Expressing personal views on the internet is also governed by the Press Freedom Law.\\n\\nThe European Union (EU) has issued a Code of Conduct on the internet with the commitment to action of the world\\'s four largest online businesses including Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Microsoft. These moves aim to \"ensure the people\\'s right to true freedom of expression and create the basis for building a truly democratic and civilized society\".\\n\\nMost recently, in the midst of a \"storm\" of fake news about the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of countries around the world have implemented many sanctions, from warnings, fines to jailing those who spread false rumors. true. In China, the act of spreading false information about the epidemic is punishable by fines, public surveillance or imprisonment from 3 to 7 years if causing serious consequences. In South Korea, President Moon Jae-in declared spreading fabricated information about the epidemic a \"serious offense\". Meanwhile, in Malaysia, the Government has arrested 6 people for posting false information about the Corona virus. Iranian police also arrested a person for posting a fake video, announcing a hospitalized COVID-19 patient on social networks. In the UK, a \"misinformation control unit\" has been set up to conduct the identification of COVID-19 fake news and liaise with media businesses to remove it.\\n\\nThe fight against abuse of freedom of expression in cyberspace in Vietnam today\\n\\nFreedom in general and freedom of speech in particular need to be understood as freedom within the framework of the law. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1953 European Convention on Human Rights, and the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights all affirm the right to freedom of expression, but also emphasize freedom of speech as freedom. within the limits of morality and destructionp law, mainly aimed at protecting the dignity, honor (private life) of others, protecting business secrets, anti-discrimination, anti-discrimination, anti-incitement to violence, war, anti-criticism , criticize the government, especially if it is called for riots, threatening public order and national security. Therefore, each country can consider its actual situation to concretize the exercise of citizens\\' right to freedom of expression.\\n\\nObviously, in any political regime there can be no absolute freedom of speech, countries strictly handle acts of abusing freedom of speech; promoting freedom of speech must be for the common good, not the absolutization of individual freedom, not taking advantage of freedom of speech to write, speak, or distort with bad intentions, regardless of morality and law. France.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, the Party and State always respect and guarantee human rights, including citizens\\' right to freedom of expression. Freedom of speech is considered a constitutional right right in the first Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1946: “Vietnamese citizens have the following rights: freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of organization and assembly, freedom of belief, freedom of residence and movement in the country and abroad” (Article 10). The 2013 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam continues to affirm: “Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, access to information, assembly, association, and demonstration. The exercise of these rights is provided for by law” (Article 25). Besides, we also have the Press Law 2016, the Law on Access to Information 2016. Our country\\'s legal framework on basic freedom of expression is adequate, synchronous and compatible with international law on human rights. Like other countries in the world, Vietnam has regulations to limit and prevent acts of abusing freedom of speech, infringing upon national interests, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations. , citizen.\\n\\nAware of the importance, benefits and dangers of the internet and social networks, our Party and State have adopted appropriate guidelines and policies to develop the internet and social networks; at the same time protect network security and prevent and fight against taking advantage of the internet and social networks to distort, oppose the government, and infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. Among them are Directive No. 28-CT/TW, dated September 16, 2013, of the Secretariat of the XI term, on \"Strengthening the work of ensuring network information security\"; Decree No. 72/2013/ND-CP, dated July 15, 2013, of the Government, on “Management, provision and use of internet services and online information”; Directive No. 15/CT-TTg, dated June 17, 2014, of the Prime Minister, on \"Strengthening the work of ensuring network information security and safety in the new situation\". The document of the 12th Party Congress clearly states: \"Focusing on the management of various types of information on the internet to orient the people\\'s ideology and aesthetics, especially youth and teenagers\". In addition, during the implementation of Resolution No. 35-NQ/TW, dated January 22, 2018, of the Politburo, on \"Strengthening the protection of the Party\\'s ideological foundation, and fighting against false views. contrary, hostile in the new situation\", the Central Propaganda Department has strengthened the direction of the work of fighting and countering false information and claims, conspiracy, and activities taking advantage of the internet and social networks to fight back. destroy the Party and the State. The Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Public Security proactively detect, fight, prevent and strictly handle those who take advantage of the internet and social networks to violate the law. The Cyber \\u200b\\u200bCommand (Ministry of Defense) was established under Decision No. 1198/QD-TTg, dated August 15, 2017, by the Prime Minister, playing a pivotal role in ensuring security. , national cyber security, fight against high-tech crime and \"peaceful evolution\" in cyberspace. The Press Law 2016, the Law on Access to Information in 2016 and the Law on Cybersecurity in 2018, both clearly stipulate acts such as posting and spreading false information, distorting, defaming, denying the government; fabricating, causing confusion among the people; distort history; denying revolutionary achievements; offend the nation, national hero; Untrue information, slander, insult to the reputation of agencies and organizations, honor and dignity of individuals ... are handled by law.\\n\\nReactionary and hostile forces at home and abroad have been taking advantage of freedom of speech to distort and destroy our Party and State, smear and slander the government, incite and panic among the people. , threatening national security and social order and safety. For example, regarding the passage of the Law on Cybersecurity, many websites and reactionary elements have distorted and distorted information, claiming that this law \"especially infringes on private space\", violate freedom of speech, the press, the internet\". Some people do not have enough information, lack of understanding, so they easily believe and make opposing statements, hindering the implementation of the Law. The Dong Tam incident on January 9, 2020 caused shock and division in the community because of too many conflicting news streams on social networks. Enemy forces also take the opportunityThis propaganda aims to destroy the regime…\\n\\nThe phenomenon of spreading fake and false information online also causes many consequences. For example, while the State is making efforts to prevent, control and repel the COVID-19 epidemic, there are people who take advantage of the epidemic situation to propagate false information, distort the Party\\'s policies and guidelines, State policies cause confusion in public opinion. They fabricated a false picture of the epidemic situation in Vietnam, spread fake news, made up stories about the number of infected people, the number of deaths, and announced that the rate of disease spread was many times higher than that of the Government. government announcements, creating fear in the community, disturbing social life, causing doubts and conflicts between the people, the Party and the State. Through baseless information, hostile forces deliberately ignored the important results we have achieved, downplaying the Party\\'s leadership role, the State\\'s management capacity in handling the epidemic, slandered the State for concealing information, failing to prevent the epidemic from the beginning… Not only that, many subjects also intentionally spread false information about the epidemic situation in order to gain illicit profits. It is negative information that makes people afraid, rush to buy masks, hoard food, leading to the situation of \"picking up\" goods, \"blowing\" prices... Such acts cannot be used \"freely\". speech” to defend.\\n\\nWhen we prevent the above misinformation and misinformation, hostile forces claim that this is \"a form of information censorship\", \"violating the right to freedom of speech\". The truth is, the above prevention is necessary, in accordance with the law, all countries in the world must do it. After the Ministry of Information and Communications promoted exchange and working activities with representatives of Facebook, Google proposed to prevent, process and remove information that violates Vietnamese law on social networks, thousands of videos, including videos with inciting content to destroy the Party and State, have been removed from Youtube; Thousands of links with illegal content, hundreds of fake accounts, propaganda against the Party and State have also been blocked by Facebook...\\n\\nTo fight against abuse of freedom of expression in cyberspace, it is necessary to implement synchronously the following solutions:\\n\\nFirstly, education and propaganda to raise the responsibility of network users and the spirit of vigilance against rumors. Raising awareness and self-screening capacity of people and communities, forming positive behavior habits in the online environment. This is a key and long-term solution for each citizen to become an effective information filter for themselves and the community.\\n\\nSecondly, regularly monitoring, surveying, evaluating, promptly adjusting, supplementing and perfecting the legal system, mechanisms and policies to help effective management while being consistent with the rules governing administrative culture in social and community activities, while keeping up with the development of social networks.\\n\\nThird, it is necessary to strengthen technical measures. Specifically, adequate investment in agencies responsible for ensuring national cyber security and safety. Recruit and train a team of experts who are good at information technology, capable of effectively implementing technical and professional measures.

      " 'Freedom of expression is one of the fundamental human rights enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 19, Universal Declaration human rights (UDHR) in 1948 states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression; including freedom to hold opinions without interference; as well as freedom to seek, receive and impart ideas and information through any media, and without frontiers”. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1966 also stipulates: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas, regardless of domain, orally, in writing, in print, or in the form of art, through any media of their choice”. It can be said that freedom of speech is an important basis for the full realization of other human rights and is associated with the right to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, association, freedom of thought, belief and religion. education, as well as the right to participate in the management of state and social affairs.\\nHowever, along with the development of information technology in this day and age, the form of expression of free speech has undergone a great change. The Internet and social networks have become popular tools for all individuals and organizations to express their views and ideas, spread information, and express their right to freedom of expression.

      " 'Freedom of speech in Vietnam is upheld and guaranteed\\n\\n“Everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression; including freedom to hold opinions without interference, as well as freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”(1). That is the main content of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), adopted and published by the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with Resolution 271A (III), dated 10- December 1948. More than 70 years of existence, the Declaration is still valid, considered a declaration of great human meaning, has been, is and will still be the striving goal of all mankind.\\n\\nFor each country and nation, the inheritance, development, application and adherence to the values \\u200b\\u200bof the Declaration are different, governed by specific political, economic, social and cultural characteristics. But there is a mandatory common point that these freedoms must be within the framework of the law, as stipulated in Articles 29 and 30 of the Declaration itself.\\n\\nMarx and Ph. Engels, from the point of view of dialectical materialism, by objectively examining bourgeois human rights with a critical spirit, came to the affirmation: “Rights can never be higher than the economic system and cultural development is determined by that economic regime”(2); corresponding to different eras and different socio-economic bases have different rights. Accordingly, the concept of free speech is not constant, but changes in history.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, with a vision beyond the times, leader Nguyen Ai Quoc soon shaped the idea of \\u200b\\u200bfree speech. In his speech at the 18th National Congress of the French Socialist Party, in 1921, he accused the French colonialists of stifling freedom of speech for the people of Annam: \"We do not have the right to press freedom of the press. freedom of speech and expression, not even the right to freedom of assembly and association. We do not have the right to reside and travel abroad; we have to live in darkness of ignorance because we do not have the freedom to study. In Indochina, the colonialists tried everything to poison us with opium and make us stupid with alcohol. They have killed thousands of Annamites and slaughtered thousands of others to protect interests that are not their own”(3). Therefore, in the claim of the people of Annam, Nguyen Ai Quoc called on allied governments in general and the French government in particular to recognize the basic rights of the people of Annam, including the right to freedom. While waiting for the national principle to move from the realm of ideals into the realm of reality, where the sacred self-determination of the peoples is truly recognized, the people of the former Annam, now being the country of East - France, I would like to present to the Allied Governments in general and to the venerable French Government in particular, the following modest claims: ... 3. Freedom of the press and freedom of expression ”(4). Consistent with that claim, leader Ho Chi Minh in the Viet Minh Program, advocated: \"The people\\'s government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, elected by the National Congress, will implement the following policies: . ..2. Promulgating democratic freedoms for the people: Freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of organization, freedom of belief, freedom of movement within the country, freedom to emigrate. Abolish conscription and oppressive regimes imposed by the empire” (5).\\n\\nRealizing the idea of \\u200b\\u200bfreedom of speech, just over a year after the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on November 9, 1946, the National Assembly approved a Constitution consisting of 7 chapters and 70 articles, inheriting the quintessence of national culture and the main ideology of humanity, in line with the country\\'s reality; in which, the right to freedom of speech is constitutionally stated in Article 10: “Vietnamese citizens have the following rights: Freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of organization and assembly, freedom of belief, freedom of residence residence, travel within the country and abroad”. Implementing the first Constitution of our country in general and exercising the right to freedom of speech in particular, only 3 years later, in an interview with Mr. Walter Briggs, March 1949, published in the National Salvation Newspaper, no. 1198, on March 23, 1949, Ho Chi Minh affirmed the achievement of freedom of speech very clearly: “Q: Is there freedom of speech in Vietnam (apart from treasonous and pro-French colonial speeches) )? Answer: Yes”. Continuing to affirm the right to freedom of speech in the Report on the draft Amended Constitution at the 11th session of the First National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, read on December 18, 1959, he continued to affirm that the right Freedom of speech is one of the basic rights of citizens...\\n\\nA unique feature of Ho Chi Minh\\'s thought on the right to freedom of expression is that this right must be coupled with personal obligations and responsibilities. Freedom of speech and thought are a fundamental and most important value of human rights. He explained: “Our regime is a democracy, thoughts must be free. What is freedom? On all issues, people are free to express their opinions, contributing to finding the truth. It is a right but also an obligation of everyone. When people have expressed their opinions, have found tWhen you see the truth, then the freedom of thought turns into the freedom to submit to the truth. Truth is something beneficial to the Fatherland, to the people. What is contrary to the interests of the Fatherland and the people is not the truth. To strive to serve the Fatherland, to serve the people - that is, to submit to the truth\"(6).\\n\\nThoroughly grasping and applying Ho Chi Minh\\'s thought on the right to freedom of expression, during the renovation period, in accordance with the 1992 and 2013 Constitutions, the documents of the Party and State(7) affirm and realize citizens\\' right to freedom of speech.\\n\\nIt can be understood that, freedom of speech is the freedom to express one\\'s opinions to discuss a common issue; is the right of citizens to participate in discussions, discussions and contribute opinions on common issues of society.\\n\\nIn fact, Vietnam has always faced hostile elements and forces both at home and abroad, in many different fields and fronts, including the ideological and information front. Reactionary and hostile forces always find ways to distort, fabricate, distort and slander the guidelines and policies of the Party and State in all fields, denying the achievements that have been achieved. including achievements recognized and appreciated by international friends.\\n\\nIn the process of national construction and development, in order to be consistent with reality, in the context of the \"flat world\", globalization and deeper international integration, Vietnam has adjusted, supplemented and built build many new laws, upholding and respecting basic and legitimate human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. Article 25 of the 2013 Constitution clearly stipulates: “Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, access to information, assembly, association, and demonstration. The exercise of these rights is prescribed by law”. Or as in the recently enacted laws, such as the Law on Access to Information (2013); Law on Press (2016); Law on Cybersecurity (2018)..., the right to freedom of speech is always respected and guaranteed. Since joining the global internet on December 1, 1997, Vietnam has continuously set new records, guaranteed freedom of speech and press, and best met the needs of searchers. search, exchange and enjoy information anytime, anywhere, in all aspects, ... of the people both on the mass media, as well as on social media.

Press planning is extremely necessary, when many press agencies have deviant expressions, away from the principles and purposes, commercialization, and one-sided information, focusing only on the negative and negative sides. ... in society, lack of education, even counterproductive, spreading bad things. The implementation of planning and rearrangement of the press system in Vietnam is for the press to operate professionally, to grow stronger, to catch up with the development of the world press... However, immediately, appeared on social networks, especially the Vietnamese versions of some foreign press agencies, with very impulsive and unfounded information... They tried to fabricate and slander that: Press plan to 2025: Reduce quantity, still keep tight control” (RFA, April 3, 2019), “Planning the press \\'according to the style of considering the press as a tool\\'?” (BBC, April 9, 2019), \"The press planning is \"unconstitutional\", will \"employ\" thousands of journalists? (VOA, April 9, 2019)... Similarly, the social networking sites of individuals and organizations that oppose, disrupt, and react, also join in saying, \"Vietnam does not have a press system. independent\", \"Controversial press planning\", \"Press planning - reporters lose their jobs, readers lose choices?\"...\\n\\nThe Acknowledged Achievements and Endings of So-called \"Free Speech\"\\n\\nTorefuting and affirming the absurd \"free speech\" that hostile elements and forces distort, inflate, and spread widely on cyberspace, nothing is more convincing than stating it. The results and achievements that Vietnam has achieved have been recognized and appreciated by international friends.\\n\\nVietnam has gradually improved its legal system, basically meeting the requirements set forth for the promotion, protection and development of human rights and citizens\\' rights, including the right to freedom of expression. For that reason, Vietnam was elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (term of 2008 - 2009), a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council (term of 2014 - 2016), a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council (term of 2014 - 2016). United Nations Economic - Social Organization (term 2016 - 2018), member of the Executive Council of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (term of 2015 - 2019). According to the election results at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly announced on June 7, 2019, Vietnam received 192/193 votes in favor, far exceeding the minimum milestone of 129/193, officially being elected in 2016. the seat of a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the term 2020\\u2005\\u2005-2021. These are the most convincing evidences that affirms that there is freedom of speech in Vietnam and opposes those who intend to sabotage the country by means of things. \"free speech\" is full of hatred, evil, and lack of grounds...\\n\\nWhile the world situation is complicated and unpredictable in many aspects, the socio-economic development, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) of Vietnam has always achieved the top growth rate compared to other countries. countries in the region and around the world. In particular, in the first 9 months of 2019, GDP increased by 6.98% - the highest increase in the past 9 years. Inflation continued to be controlled at a low level, an average increase of 2.5% in 9 months - the lowest increase in the past 3 years. Total social investment increased by 10.3%, especially the non-state sector accounted for 45.3%, up 16.9%. Realized FDI capital is the highest in recent years, estimated at 14.2 billion USD, up 7.3%. State budget revenue increased sharply (10.1%), overspending fell to 3.4% of GDP, public debt remained below 57% of GDP... These are convincing figures of economic development. - Vietnam\\'s society, as well as a favorable, safe and attractive investment environment for foreign investors, especially the emergence of more and more large economic groups in the world...\\n\\nFor a long time, the saying \"half a bread is still bread, but half the truth is not the truth\" has been very familiar and widely accepted in the world. This is not debatable. And with the press - media, one of the most important principles in its operation is to reflect the objective truth, respecting the truth in an absolute and complete way. Therefore, the fact that reactionary objects and organizations take advantage of, in the name of \"half-truths\", cropping to paint, embellish, add, etc., according to their imaginations and scenarios. Pre-set, intentionally created, it is clear that it is a lie, swindle, deliberately distorting for the purpose of anti-evil.\\n\\nIn the spirit of nation building, it is clear that every Vietnamese has the right to express his patriotism, to give suggestions and criticisms to the guidelines of the Party, policies and laws of the State... But Free speech, indiscretion, distortion, incitement to cause trouble, destruction of property, and violation of the law are condemnable actions that need to be promptly prevented and dealt with severely. Because people who know how to obey the law are people who are fully aware of freedom. If you can consciously control your behavior, then you will be truly free. Freedom is a human right, but it is not an arbitrary, arbitrary, anarchic freedom, but it is only guaranteed when people properly perceive the objective law and act in accordance with the law. agreements and agreements on the freedom of the collective, the community, and the society.\\n\\nAdmittedly, in any country in the world, there are always certain limitations and weaknesses, besides progress and development, due to specific conditions. The problem is that each country will have to recognize and overcome those limitations in a timely, thorough, comprehensive, drastic manner... to always create a good environment for development and progress. sustainable, avoid being misrepresented, distorted, taken advantage of to attack or destroy... In Vietnam, through recent events, it can be seen that people also need to be mobilized and propagated. raise awareness about freedom properly, clearly define responsibilities and obligations of citizens, know right - wrong, good - bad, build - destroy, ... to equip themselves, protect themselves against those who take advantage of patriotism, take advantage of people\\'s frustrations to incite destruction. It must be made clear to the people that freedom does not mean being arbitrary, indiscriminate, doing whatever you want. True freedom of expression reflects cognitive capacity and self-control in both speech and action. After all, the right action is an accurate measure of the true value of free speech. Can\\'t say \"freedom of source\"opinions” but actions destroy the freedom of others, social freedom. Freedom only expands in step with improving people\\'s understanding of the laws of nature, society and human thinking. race, so that they can control themselves and act freely. Freedom is formed and exists in the relationship between the individual and society, the individual and the State. Patriotism needs to be shown with a proper attitude, calm, restrained, controlled, etc. so as not to repeat extreme acts of destruction, destruction or destruction of property of the State and organizations. , domestic and foreign enterprises, going against the right guidelines and policies in socio-economic development of our Party and State.\\n\\nSome immediate solutions...\\n\\nFaced with new developments on the ideological front, on October 22, 2018, the Politburo issued Resolution No. 35-NQ/TW on strengthening the protection of the Party\\'s ideological foundation, fighting to refute the views of the Communist Party of Vietnam. wrong, hostile in the new situation. Then, on March 25, 2019, the Secretariat issued Plan No. 14-KH/TW to implement Resolution No. 35. According to Plan No. 14, the implementation of Resolution No. 35 should be associated with continued continue to thoroughly grasp and organize the implementation of relevant Party resolutions, directives, conclusions and regulations. As for the matter against taking advantage of \"free speech\" to arbitrarily \"free speech\" to entice, incite, cause riots and subversion of hostile and reactionary forces, we would like to propose Some basic solutions are as follows:\\n\\nFirstly, soon consolidate the building of specialized forces in the direction of being lean and strong enough in the spirit of Resolution No. 35-NQ/TW. At the same time, bring into full play the responsibilities of Party committees and organizations at all levels, first of all of the leaders in protecting the ideological foundation of the Party, fighting against wrong and hostile views. The specialized forces are the key people and pioneers in the consistent, synchronous and effective implementation of the objectives, viewpoints as well as the tasks and solutions stated in the Resolution No. 35-NQ /TW, with short-term, long-term plans, short-term, medium-term, long-term roadmaps and unexpected cases in accordance with the actual situation in a flexible, scientific and appropriate manner.\\n\\nThe formation of a specialized and elite force in all fields, to be able to promptly detect and expose the plots and tricks deliberately caused by hostile forces, reactionaries, and political opportunities and fight against them. fight against dark conspiracies in many different ways, both in the mass media, as well as in cyberspace, helping the majority of people understand the nature of information, and be immune to it.\" \"free speech\" is unethical and illegal, and recognizes and understands the malice of extremists, agitators, and anti-saboteurs...\\n\\nSecond, the agencies and units assigned to the task are responsible for strengthening the propaganda of the contents of Resolution No. 35-NQ/TW, Plan No. 14-KH/TW on a regular and creative basis. scientific, easy to remember, easy to understand, avoid hard, cliché, dogmatic, difficult to come to life. It is necessary to propagate widely and practically 4 regular tasks in the Plan No. 14-KH/TW have been clearly defined, which are: Promote propaganda, increase positive information; to step up research and perfect the theoretical system on socialism and the road to socialism in our country in the new situation; renovating and improving the quality and effectiveness of the dissemination, fostering and updating of political theory knowledge; strengthen management, educate cadres and party members, strictly handle violations... At the same time, all levels and functional sectors need to promptly provide accurate and objective information to fight opposing and directing public opinion against information contrary to the Party\\'s guidelines, policies and laws of the State, helping grassroots committees have timely orientation...\\n\\nThird, continue to perfect institutions and policies, especially on international integration, economic development, social justice, etc. to create a solid foundation and foundation to contribute to promoting development. country development. Only then will we not create \"gaps\", \"gaps\" for the formation, arising and existence of \"interest groups\", corrupt officials, corruption and negativity in society. .. Besides, it is necessary to promote the positive results achieved in socio-economic development in recent years, to create momentum for the next breakthroughs, with the expectation of achieving outstanding achievements. more prominent in promoting growth momentum, improving living standards, ensuring social security for people, shortening the development gap between regions and regions throughout the country...\\n\\n Fourth, step up the fight against corruption and negativity from the central to local levels, avoiding the situation of \"above hot, under cold\". It can be affirmed that the fight against corruption and negativity in recent years has achieved many positive results, regaining the confidence of the majority of the people in the Party\\'s leadership and management. gorvernment\\'s. Obviously, this is the problemThis is an important issue that is a great concern of the entire Party and people, so we cannot be hasty and make mistakes. But also because of that, it is impossible to \"slow down\", indispensable in directing and implementing, especially speeding up the progress of verification, investigation and handling of serious corruption cases. , complex, people interested.\\n\\nFifth, to build and set up a system of synchronous, coherent and effective propaganda solutions on the mass media and in cyberspace, contributing to early identification and proactive struggle. , effective against all offensive and destructive tricks of hostile forces. Press agencies need to organize more balanced information, increase information on positive and good aspects of society, avoid information imbalance, and make hostile and reactionary forces rely on them. and in the name of \"free speech\" to distort and slander the country with grayscale... The press agencies need to increase the amount of time for columns fighting to protect the ideological foundation of the Party. At the same time, it is necessary to form and maintain effective operation of information pages on social networks, especially on social networks. The social network Facebook is organized scientifically, methodically, with a team of professionals in charge to promptly, proactively identify and fight methodically, scientifically, accurately, persuasively and effectively against conspiracies, tricks and counter-actions of hostile and reactionary forces...\\n\\nSixth, it is necessary to promptly detect and identify to fight and punish saboteurs hiding in the name of \"patriotic\", \"human rights\", \"claiming justice for the people\" to incite and create seeds of rioting, subversion, ... in all different aspects and forms. It is necessary to isolate, isolate and properly identify the reactionary, sabotage, agitator, mastermind in each case and incident, as well as have deliberately committed violations for a long time, systematically to bring them to serious trial. before the law...\\n\\nThat way, the \"free speech\" in Vietnam will not be taken advantage of, misrepresented, distorted, or arbitrarily convey the \"free speech\" in order to entice and provoke insecurity and disorder. then, gradually, with the strong resistance of all classes of people, that cheap, hateful, dissenting \"free speech\" came to be. no longer viable and destroyed, returning a healthy environment for genuine freedom of expression, for the sustainable development of the country'\n",
      " 'The truth behind the guise of taking advantage of freedom of speech and press freedom\\n\\nEnemy forces, political opportunities, and discontent at home and abroad in the name of \"democracy and human rights\" try to make excuses to change white for black, saying no to yes, yes to no about the reality of freedom speech and press freedom in Vietnam today. At the same time, they thoroughly took advantage of the unbiased, honest and unfaithful assessment of some foreign news agencies and presses about the situation of freedom of speech and press freedom in Vietnam to slander. Vietnam violates democracy and human rights in order to lower our country\\'s position and reputation in the international arena.\\n\\nTo achieve the goal, they established a number of organizations in the name of the press such as: \"Reporters Without Borders\", \"The project 88\"... to fight for the so-called \"prisoners of conscience\", \"prisoners\" politics\", giving false rankings of press freedom in Vietnam and some countries, slandering Vietnam to stifle freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Putting pressure on the release of those arrested by the authorities for violating Vietnamese law such as: Tran Thi Tuyet Dieu, Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Le Huu Minh Tuan, Pham Doan Trang, Le Trong Hung, Tran Quoc Khanh, Truong Chau Huu Danh, Nguyen Thanh Nha, Doan Kien Giang, Nguyen Phuoc Trung Bao… Deeperly, taking advantage of the name of fighting for \"press freedom\" to gather forces and form political groups. anti-government organization.\\n\\nIt is necessary to affirm that Vietnam is a responsible member of the international community, we abide by international law, including Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. and expression; including freedom to hold opinions without interference, as well as freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”.\\n\\nThe Declaration is still valid, has great human meaning, is always adhered to, inherited and developed by the State of Vietnam in each situation. Going back in history, on November 9, 1946, the National Assembly approved a Constitution consisting of 7 chapters and 70 articles, in which, the right to freedom of speech is constitutionally stated in Article 10: “Vietnamese citizens have the right to: Freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of organization and assembly, freedom of belief, freedom of residence, freedom of movement in the country and abroad.\\n\\nInheriting the provisions on freedom of expression from the first Constitution, the Party\\'s documents, the 1959, 1980, 1992 and 2013 Constitutions all affirmed and realized the right to freedom of speech and freedom of speech. by citizen journalism. Article 25 of the 2013 Constitution clearly states: “Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, access to information, assembly, association, and demonstration. The exercise of these rights is prescribed by law”.\\n\\nIn order to ensure freedom of speech and press freedom, the National Assembly of Vietnam has promulgated the Law on Access to Information and the Amended Press Law in 2016. In which, Article 3 The Law on Access to Information stipulates: “All citizens are equal, without discrimination in exercising the right to access information; the information provided must be accurate and complete; the provision of information must be timely, transparent and convenient for citizens; The State creates favorable conditions for people with disabilities, people living in border areas, islands, mountainous areas and areas with extremely difficult socio-economic conditions to exercise their right to access information. Article 10 of this law also stipulates that citizens have the right to freely access information disclosed by state agencies and at the same time to request state agencies to provide information.\\n\\nAs for the citizen\\'s right to freedom of expression in the press, which is stipulated in Article 11, the revised Press Law: “Expressing opinions on the situation of the country and the world; participate in the formulation and implementation of guidelines, guidelines and policies of the Party and laws of the State; comments, criticisms, recommendations, complaints and denunciations in the press for organizations and individuals”.\\n\\nArticle 13 clearly states: “The State creates favorable conditions for citizens to exercise their right to freedom of the press, the right to freedom of expression in the press and to let the press play its rightful role; press and journalists operate within the framework of the law and are protected by the State. No one may abuse the right to freedom of the press, the right to freedom of expression in the press to infringe upon the interests of the State, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and citizens; uncensored press prior to printing, transmission, and broadcasting”.\\n\\nThus, since the birth of our State until now, the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press has always been respected, guaranteed and increasingly enforced in life, creating conditions for citizens to speak up. speak their minds, contribute their talents, wisdom and efforts to the cause of national construction and defense. Simultaneously with the protection, respect and guarantee of the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press, it is an expression of the strictness of the law; not allow organizations and individuals to take advantage of their freedom to exercise their freedom in excess of the law, with nefarious interests, and against the values \\u200b\\u200bof freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\\n\\nTalking numbers\\n\\nBy the end of 2020,Vietnam has 41,000 active employees, 779 press agencies (including 142 newspapers, 612 magazines, 25 electronic press agencies), 72 agencies licensed to operate broadcasting and television with total 87 radio channels and 193 transmission channels. Vietnam is also recognized as one of the countries with the highest Internet growth and usage rates in the world. Information technology and social networks have been widely used in life and activities in Vietnam.\\n\\nAccording to the report \"Mobile application market 2021\" released by Appota, Vietnam has about 70% of the population using mobile phones, of which 64% of subscribers have 3G and 4G connections. The percentage of the population using the Internet also accounts for 70%, the number of users using the Internet via mobile devices accounts for about 95% and on average they have 3 hours and 18 minutes to use the Internet via mobile devices. This is quite an impressive number, proving that smartphones are being prioritized as the main connection device thanks to their convenience and popularity.\\n\\nThe number of Facebook users in Vietnam (in 2020) is 69,280,000 people, accounting for 70.1% of the population. The quality of Internet access in Vietnam basically meets the standards, some parameters are higher than those published by international systems. This reflects the efforts of Internet service providers in Vietnam to serve the needs of Internet users. Waves of major news agencies and newspapers such as CNN, BBC, TV5, NHK, DW, Australia Network, KBS, Bloomberg... are easily accessible in Vietnam.\\n\\nThe above evidences show that, undeniably, great and solid achievements in ensuring freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Vietnam and the proactive implementation of national commitments in a serious and effective manner are undeniable. to ensure freedom of speech and freedom of the press in which Vietnam participates. Let the Vietnamese people judge for themselves the reality of exercising their right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, because no one else, each Vietnamese citizen is an insider. Where is the limit, responsibility, obligation?\\n\\nDistorted and slanderous statements that do not come from the voice of the people, do not represent the people, are not by the people and for the people, how can they be called objective, how can the voice of democracy be expressed as what it is? hostile forces, political opportunities.\\n\\nObviously, freedom of speech, freedom of the press all have certain limits, not excessive freedom. We welcome constructive ideas and practical contributions to the cause of national construction and defense; at the same time condemn and criticize ideas with the intention to sabotage the renovation and development in our country.'\n",
      " 'If the Law on Cybersecurity is passed and takes effect, Vietnam will have a standard legal framework to protect its sovereignty, independence, national security and social order and safety in cyberspace.\\n\\nIn recent days, before, during and after the National Assembly passed the Law on Cybersecurity and the announcement of the President\\'s Order on this Law, domestic and foreign public opinion was very concerned. However, hiding under the guise of \"free speech\", taking advantage of the Party\\'s policy of \"Appreciating the role of scientific research agencies in consulting, criticizing, and assessing the society in policy making. , the Party\\'s guidelines, the State\\'s policies and laws, and economic, cultural and social development projects\"[1], opportunists and hostile forces at home and abroad. there are tricks to distort the Cybersecurity Law for the purpose of causing information chaos, creating mistrust and bad public opinion in society; thereby, distorting the correct guidelines and policies of the Party and State on promulgating laws. Therefore, it is very urgent to identify and fight against the distortion of the current Cybersecurity Law.\\n\\n1. Identify allegations that distort the current Cybersecurity Law\\n\\nFirstly, opportunists and hostile forces at home and abroad think that our promulgation of the Cybersecurity Law is a temporary measure of our Party and State to deal with dissenters. political opinion. It is not difficult to recognize those false and out of place claims of foreign news agencies, press and domestic political opportunists \"like poisonous mushrooms after the rain\" of BBC, RFA, VOA, RFI stations. ... Typically VOV Vietnamese with a series of articles full of distortions such as: \"A movement to disobey the Cybersecurity Law\" ... and on the internet, social networks, there is some information that the Law on Cybersecurity Law \"Invasion of privacy\"; “infringement on freedom of speech and civil rights”; “robbing people of the right to use the internet” and restricting international relations, restraining the development of Vietnam? Are these things true?\\n\\nThe truth is not so! It must be affirmed that the development and implementation of the Law on Cybersecurity is a major undertaking and policy of our Party and State in the new situation. Right in the Document of the 12th National Congress, our Party advocates: \"Actively struggle to defeat all plots and counter-actions of hostile forces; preventing and opposing false information and claims, repelling crimes and social evils; ready to respond to traditional and non-traditional security threats; ensuring security, information safety and network security”[2], especially in the context that “the international community has to deal more and more drastically with traditional and non-traditional security challenges, especially especially cyber security and new forms of warfare”[3]; Meanwhile, “Security, social order and safety in some areas are still complicated. Protecting state secrets is still weak. The work of ensuring safety, information security and network security is still inadequate”[4]. Therefore, the 5th session of the XIV National Assembly passed the Law on Cybersecurity to further institutionalize the 2013 Constitution and the Resolution of the 12th Party Congress to perfect the legal system on cybersecurity with all for the sake of The goal is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all citizens, for the stable development of Vietnam and in accordance with international law. Therefore, the above false claim is not only theoretically ambiguous, but also reactionary in practice.\\n\\nSecond, they think that the contents of the Cybersecurity Law are very vague and that no country has this law. According to the Vietnam Military Encyclopedia: “Security is a state of stability and safety, with no signs of threatening the existence and normal development of individuals, organizations, each field or of the world. the whole society… Maintaining comprehensive security is a condition for comprehensive development”[5]. Article 2, Clause 1 of the Law on Cybersecurity affirms: “Cybersecurity is the assurance that operations in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, rights and interests lawful organizations and individuals\". Thus, in terms of terminology - network security - in terms of its content, it has shown the necessity to issue and implement this law.\\n\\nTheir claim that “no country has this law”! This is yet another fabrication based on conceptual swapping. To date, 138 countries have had Cybersecurity laws including topical laws and regulatory provisions scattered among other laws, and many of those laws are much stricter than those of Vietnam. On December 7, 2015, parliamentarians and member states of the European Union (EU) reached an agreement on the first Cybersecurity Law applicable to the whole bloc: “According to the above law, service providers Online services such as: Google and Amazon will have to report any serious violations to national authorities or they will be fined. The new law, titled \"Information and Cybersecurity Guidelines,\" sets out strict security and reporting requirements for companies operating in key sectors, such as transportation, energy, and logistics. quality, health and financeing. Companies operating on the Internet such as: Google, Amazon, eBay and Cisco will have to report serious violations to national authorities or they will face sanctions from these agencies.”[6 ].\\n\\nIn Germany, the Ministry of Justice attaches great importance to cyber security. They give clear instructions to Facebook, if it is not well managed so that people can incite violence, curse online, and misrepresent it, they will be severely punished from Facebook managers to those who speak out. The Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (NetzDG) \\u200b\\u200bAct was passed in the middle of last year but officially took effect on January 1, 2018 after a 2-month extension for social network service providers to develop speech prevention tools. inciting hatred [7].\\n\\nOr in Korea, using social networks to launch insults at a certain \"idol\", you will soon receive a lawsuit from the famous character\\'s management company. Thus, the argument that \"the contents of the Cybersecurity Law are very vague and no country has this law\" is a fabrication, completely contrary to what is in fact.\\n\\nThird, they believe that foreign network companies will not provide user information at the request of the Vietnamese Government - playing \"own rules\". This is also a fabrication because every year, Facebook has a database report for the governments of the countries that are their markets. A total of 103 countries and territories, including Vietnam[8]. And after the Law on Cybersecurity was officially passed by the National Assembly, the Facebook representative in Vietnam said that Facebook\\'s activities were not affected in Vietnam. Moreover, Facebook is completing legal procedures to prepare to establish a representative office in Vietnam; help Facebook operate better, as well as coordinate better with the Vietnamese Government in the future. And so far, Google, Facebook and some other carriers still operate normally in Vietnam as well as not intends to withdraw from a potential market like Vietnam. Thus, the above argument is completely baseless.\\n\\n2. Raise vigilance, smash reactionary thoughts, provoke and cause trouble\\n\\nFirst of all, we need to continue explaining, propagating and clarifying the contents of the Cybersecurity Law so that all classes of people can understand and grasp it, and each citizen should raise their vigilance against insidious conspiracies and tricks. poison of hostile forces. Resolutely smash some extremists\\' claims to incite and cause trouble, take advantage of democracy to oppose good guidelines and policies of our Party and State, including the Law on Cybersecurity. . At the same time, raise awareness and actively implement a number of specific contents and tasks as follows:\\n\\nFirstly, among those who have little understanding of Vietnamese law and international public law, especially the Free Trade Agreements (AFTA) that Vietnam has signed with countries within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). World Trade Organization (WTO) or the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). However, so far, the world has never had a concept that considers cyberspace as a commodity, but only units of information transmitted and received in cyberspace are goods measured in Bytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes. , Tetabyte.v.v. The Vietnam Cybersecurity Law does not have any provisions on taxing import and export of information units, but only regulations on copyright protection for information content. And this regulation is consistent with the provisions of WTO, CPTPP on intellectual property.\\n\\nSecond, are those who are using cyberspace, even though they have not committed acts of infringement on network security, or have no acts of infringing upon national security and social order and safety, but are still afraid of being exposed. personal information, worried that carriers will withdraw from the Vietnamese market. To answer these concerns, they did not look to the official document of the Law on Cybersecurity just passed by the National Assembly, but instead received false information, distorted information, misrepresentation, even misinformation. even fabrications emanating from the media apparatus of forces hostile to Vietnam. Since then, they have had inappropriate reactions.\\n\\nThird, the forces hostile to Vietnam have fiercely opposed the passage of the Cybersecurity Law and are now fiercely opposed to bringing the Law on Cybersecurity to life. Because with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, from now on, hostile forces that oppose the State of Vietnam and go against the interests of the Vietnamese people are no longer allowed to act on their own in cyberspace. and the so-called \"freedom on the internet\" to spread information that is against the State of Vietnam, harmful to Vietnam\\'s national security and social order and safety. That is the real cause of the frenzied actions against Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law.\\n\\nThis frenzy has been evident since the 5th session of the XIV National Assembly of Vietnam began to discuss and plan to pass the Law on Cybersecurity. Conspiracy ofThese forces are taking advantage of people\\'s ignorance of the law to deceive and rely on anti-Vietnamese forces abroad to fabricate and distort the Law on Cybersecurity. Their ultimate purpose is to \"abolish Vietnam\\'s legal weapons\" so that they can blatantly infringe upon Vietnam\\'s sovereignty, independence, national security and social order in cyberspace, and grossly interfere. daring to enter Vietnam\\'s internal affairs...\\n\\nIn this anti-war campaign, the hostile forces not only through their henchmen in the country incited people to gather illegally and destroy the State\\'s property, but also provided spiritual support to the people who were living in the country. That serious violation of the law with content that is false, distorted, fabricated, slanderous, etc. In fact, many misrepresented and fabricated news and articles about Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law are published. published with a dense frequency of dozens of articles a day on BBC Vietnamese, VOA Vietnamese, Vietnamese RFA, etc., as well as the websites of the Viet Tan terrorist organization, of the so-called National Government provisional Vietnamese delegation in the US led by Dao Minh Quan. It is a fact that following the Vietnamese government\\'s declaration that Viet Tan and the Provisional National Government of Vietnam are two terrorist organizations, a number of websites of reactionary groups have been removed by the network owner. . Most recently, there is no need for Vietnamese law enforcement agencies to intervene, but only patriotic Vietnamese facebookers to report to the Facebook network operator about the act of spreading information inciting violence posted on websites. Facebook \"Viet Tan\" and \"Patriot Diary\", the owner of the social network Facebook has temporarily deleted these two pages...\\n\\nFourthly, in addition to those who oppose Vietnam politically and harm Vietnam\\'s national security, those who commit fraudulent acts to appropriate property, launder money, traffic in people, trade drugs, trading in banned goods... and other illegal acts on the internet can no longer self-manage, causing damage to consumers.\\n\\nSubjects who are unreasonably concerned about the Law on Cybersecurity can use methods of persuasion, education, and explanation to make them understand properly. As for those who fiercely oppose the Law on Cybersecurity, it can be seen as acts against the affirmation of Vietnam\\'s rights, independence, national security and social order in cyberspace. Those are acts of treason. With the Law on Cybersecurity being passed and taking effect after half a year, Vietnam will surely have a standard legal corridor to protect its sovereignty, independence, national security and social order and safety. in cyberspace.'\n",
      " 'Cyberspace is no longer \"virtual\"\\n\\nAccording to MSc Luu Duc Quang, lecturer at the University of Economics and Law, VNU-HCM, social network users are currently facing many challenges in exercising their right to freedom of expression.\\n\\nIf only using vulgar language is just a violation of morality, but deliberately fabricating or spreading false information… is breaking the law. Therefore, each person needs to equip themselves with knowledge to avoid infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of other individuals or organizations.\\n\\nIf we detect acts that show signs of infringing on rights, we should calmly choose an appropriate course of action, limit quarrels and swear words in cyberspace, which can easily lead to loss of control, even breaking the law. It is necessary to be aware that behavior in cyberspace is no longer \"virtual\" because the legal responsibility is real.\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity Law regulates the use of social networks, but it is not a universal key to solving the problem. Therefore, when individuals and organizations show signs of being violated, they have the right to carry out legal procedures to protect them, but state management agencies cannot \"start\" the legal process on behalf of those who have been harmed. insiders, unless it is an invasion of the public interest. This is not only due to the nature of \"rights\" but also because of the overload in collecting and evaluating evidence if the responsibility falls on the authorities.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of public administration, the Ministry of Information and Communications needs to focus on perfecting two processes, namely, the internal handling process of enterprises providing cross-border information services to the user behavior of social networks and related services. mandarin. This process can make suggestions to suit the reality of our country. Second is the handling process of public authorities when receiving reports of violations from entities on the principle of ensuring the highest rights of individuals, harmonizing the interests of enterprises with law enforcement capacity. of public authorities.\\n\\n\\n\\nDefendant Tran Thi Ngoc Nu was tried by the People\\'s Court of Binh Thuan province for disturbing public order on March 18\\n\\nfor the act of livestreaming, cursing in court.

We will have many options, from criminal, administrative sanctions to court requests for apology, correction of information and compensation for damages. Put in that overall, the Law on Cybersecurity is just one of the possible options out of the many options we have.\\n\\nManaging the digital space is a must. The problem is that the approach to state management of the digital space also shows how our approach to freedom of expression is. From empirical observations, I believe that there are two basic sources to regulate the behavior of individuals and organizations in the digital space: State regulations and rules set by service providers or platform created.\\n\\nWe will see in some countries that the authorities have influenced service providers so that they must meet certain standards, not allow certain content to appear... for certain reasons. This control must be carried out on the principle of due diligence. After all, these rules when put into practice, it will affect people\\'s freedom of speech for better or worse depending on the content of the rules.'\n",

Moreover, cyberspace is a place where many hostile acts are no less dangerous than actual actions in real life. According to Professor Kolotov, any country has two paths: to establish order, regulate cyber sovereignty by laws, or sell this space or hand it over to outside forces. Commenting on Southeast Asia, where a number of countries are active sites of terrorist organizations, Professor Kolotov said that cyberspace is where terrorists exchange information with each other. He warned that many terrorists are even better equipped than some countries in the region in terms of cybersecurity.\\n\\nAssessing Vietnam's cybersecurity problem, Professor Kolotov said that based on the International Index of Cybersecurity, Vietnam ranks 100th in the world. According to him, the low level of network security has led to unfortunate incidents. Therefore, Mr. Kolotov said that the opposition to the application of the law on cybersecurity is abetting the country's poor state of security in the field of cybersecurity. This puts at risk not only the sovereignty of cyberspace, but also the actual sovereignty of the country.\\n\\nProfessor Kolotov also said that the passage of this law does not violate or interfere with free speech. The Law on Cybersecurity covers something completely different, which is related to the infrastructure of the Internet. This is not a matter of information, but of the management of metadata, that is, information about information. Once the law comes into effect, no one will read the private communications of users of the global computer network, there simply isn't enough memory to do so. Laws similar to the one just passed in Vietnam in the context of cyber warfare are being deployed in many countries around the world, with the aim not to infringe on the rights of citizens, but on the contrary. protect their own interests.

Companies must also notify the Office of suspected cyberattacks on their systems. The law is relevant to sectors deemed national \"critical infrastructure\", such as transportation, healthcare, water, telecommunications providers, as well as financial companies and insurance. In the new law, there are specific articles and clauses for internet users, such as the prohibition of plotting to use violence to subvert national security, and the prohibition of instigating criminal acts. In addition, the new law forces telecommunications providers to warn customers when they are attacked by hackers, providers must store data about access history for up to 6 months for investigation.\\n\\nAs a country moving towards becoming a smart nation, Singapore\\'s Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2017 allows the country\\'s Cybersecurity Authority to monitor and manage the nation\\'s cybersecurity.

      " 'With the rapid development of science and technology, cyberspace has become an indispensable component and plays an important role in building an information society and developing the knowledge economy. The explosive development of breakthrough technologies such as artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence), Internet of Things (IoThings), centralized database (Big Data), virtual reality connection (Virtual/Augmented) Reality), the sharing economies (Shared Economies), etc. have profoundly changed the cyberspace in both quality and quantity, which is expected to bring unprecedented benefits to human society, but also creates enormous potential risks. Many countries are well aware of the threats to cyber security, consider this a new challenge, a new threat of high importance and danger, so they have concretized it into policy documents and documents. legal documents such as laws or sub-law documents in more than 80 countries, organizations and international alliances such as the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, France, Canada, Korea, NATO...\\n\\n\\nIllustration (internet source)\\n\\nIn our country, the strong application and development of information technology in all fields of life has greatly contributed to speeding up the process of industrialization and modernization of the country, economic, cultural and social development. society, improve the quality of health care and education, promote the People\\'s creativity and democratic freedoms, and ensure national defense and security. However, cyberspace and some types of Internet services and applications are being used by hostile and reactionary forces to plot to conduct a \"color revolution\", \"street revolution\", \"revolution\" peaceful transformation” in order to abolish the political regime in our country. The state of posting false information, humiliating and slandering organizations and individuals is rampant in cyberspace without effective management measures, leading to many unfortunate consequences on human life and morale. , even affecting sovereignty, national interests, the nation, security and order. There are more and more cyber attacks with large scale and high intensity, increasing in severity and danger level, directly threatening national security and social order and safety.\\n\\nCyber \\u200b\\u200bterrorism emerges as a serious threat to national security. Criminal activities in cyberspace are increasing in number of cases and sophisticated tricks causing serious economic damage, affecting ideology, culture and society. Reliance on IT equipment of foreign origin is a potential threat to cybersecurity in the event of a conflict. The system of legal documents on cybersecurity has not been completed, and current documents do not meet the requirements of preventing, fighting and handling acts of using cyberspace to infringe on national security. and break the law. The above situation and risk has posed an urgent requirement to develop and promulgate a Law on Cybersecurity to prevent, fight and handle acts of using cyberspace to infringe upon national security, order and security. the whole society, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\nThe drafting process of the Law on Cybersecurity was elaborately and carefully prepared before submitting it to the National Assembly, with the participation of comments from ministries, functional agencies, more than 30 large telecommunications and information technology enterprises. domestic such as VNPT, FPT, BKAV; many domestic and foreign experts, economic and telecommunications groups, including Facabook, Google, Apple, Amazon, the US-ASEAN Business Council, the Asia Cloud Computing Association; foreign representative agencies such as the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, etc. have widely contributed opinions of the people; there is a thorough examination by the National Assembly\\'s Committee on Defense and Security; Council for Ethnic Minorities, specialized committees of the National Assembly and Standing Committee of the National Assembly. On June 12, 2018, the 5th session, the 14th National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam officially passed the Law on Cybersecurity with the rate of 86.86% of the total number of National Assembly deputies present. decidedly agree. The Law on Cybersecurity consists of 7 chapters and 43 articles, stipulating the basic contents of cybersecurity protection for information systems important for national security; preventing and handling acts of infringing upon national security in cyberspace; deploying national security protection activities in cyberspace and stipulating the responsibilities of agencies, organizations and individuals.\\n\\nImmediately after the Law on Cybersecurity was promulgated with the high consensus of the majority of the People, but besides that, there were still some issues that a part of the public wondered, specifically:\\n\\nFirstly, there is a concern that all personal information of citizens can be controlled by the Cybersecurity Law. Point a, Clause 2, Article 26 of the draft Law on Cybersecurity stipulates: “Domestic and foreign enterprises, when providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam, have the responsibility to: responsible for providing user information to the specialized cyber security force under the Ministry of Public Security upon written request to serve the investigation and handling of violations of the law on cyber security. Thus, the gliding forceg in charge of network security protection is only allowed to access personal information of users with illegal activities, with strict order and procedures (in writing), approved by competent authorities. Browser. The provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code 2015 and related documents clearly stipulate the management and use of information provided to serve the investigation and handling of illegal acts. .\\n\\nSecond, the force dedicated to protecting network security may abuse its power in handling information that violates the law in cyberspace. Article 9 of the Law on Cybersecurity stipulates: Those who commit acts of violating the provisions of this Law shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, be disciplined, administratively handled or examined for liability. criminal liability; if causing damage, they must compensate according to the provisions of law. In order to prevent the possibility of abuse of power by the specialized forces, Clause 5, Article 8 of the Law on Cybersecurity prohibits taking advantage of or abusing cybersecurity protection activities to infringe upon national sovereignty, interests and security. family, social order and safety, lawful rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals or for self-seeking purposes. The implementation of cybersecurity protection measures specified in Article 5 will assign the Government to detail the order and procedures, strictly comply with the provisions of the 2013 Constitution and the current legal system. . Authorities only apply these cybersecurity protection measures to prevent, detect, collect evidence, fight and handle law violations. The collected data and information are managed according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code 2015 on evidence and other regulations on information security in accordance with the law on protection of state secrets.\\n\\nThird, all businesses must store user data, and the regulation of user data storage may violate international commitments. According to the provisions of Article 26 of the Law on Cybersecurity, only domestic and foreign enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam have activities of collecting, exploit, analyze and process Vietnamese user data. There are 18 countries in the world that require data storage in the country, depending on the actual situation, countries may require different types of data to be stored; if they violated international commitments, these countries would not have provided such provisions (1). In documents of WTO, CPTPP such as General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994), General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Property Rights intellectual property (TRIPS) have a security exception provision, which states that “nothing in such documents shall prevent any Member from taking any action it considers necessary.” necessary to protect its essential security interests (2). Thus, it can be affirmed that Vietnam does not violate international commitments.\\n\\nFourth, the Law on Cybersecurity hinders the operation of enterprises and creates sub-licenses; regulations on setting up representative offices in Vietnam may hinder the operation of Google, Facebook, even they will withdraw from Vietnam. Of the 7 regulations related to the responsibilities of enterprises providing services in cyberspace in the Law on Cybersecurity, none of them are related to business activities of enterprises, nor are there any regulations requiring enterprises to provide services in cyberspace. requires businesses providing services in cyberspace to have a sub-license to be allowed to operate. Regulations on office placement do not hinder the operation of Facebook and Google, because: Google and Facebook have rented servers in our country (3). Storing service user data in Vietnam helps these businesses save business costs, increase access speed and improve service quality; helping domestic carriers save money when they have to buy international bandwidth. Technically, data storage in the country is easily carried out when technology allows, especially the application of cloud computing technology and these enterprises already have experience and equipment due to similar application. in many other countries. At the same time, with more than 60 million Vietnamese people using Google and Facebook services, a huge market, bringing huge profits to them, so Google and Facebook will never withdraw from the Vietnamese market, In fact, right from the time of drafting the Law on Cybersecurity, they have actively met and consulted with the Law Drafting Board so that they can still operate in the Vietnamese market safely according to Vietnamese law. and still earn legitimate profits as well as pay taxes according to Vietnamese law, without being banned'\n",
      " \"Cybersecurity law is necessary\\n\\nAccording to the report, the cybersecurity situation in Vietnam in recent years has tended to increase and develop complicatedly, with many cyber attacks on the information systems of State agencies and large enterprises, causing many problems. affecting the interests of the country, national security and social order and safety.\\n\\nIn the past years, there have been many legal documents related to information technology, telecommunications and Internet, but no legal documents specifically regulating network security have not met the requirements. practical needs of network security work.\\n\\nNational Assembly - Vu Trong Viet\\n\\nMr. Vo Trong Viet, Chairman of the National Assembly's Committee for National Defense and Security\\n\\nAt the meeting, the majority of delegates said that it is necessary to promulgate the Law on Cybersecurity. Standing Committee of National Defense and Security agrees with the scope of regulation of the draft Law, because the management and operation of information and telecommunications infrastructure has been exploited by hostile forces to advance in the past time. carry out activities to attack, sabotage network information systems, infringe upon the independence, sovereignty, national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\nAvoid overlapping, overlapping with current Laws\\n\\nSharing the same opinion as the majority of opinions of the National Assembly Standing Committee, however, National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan said that it is necessary to review the provisions of the draft Law to synchronize and avoid overlapping. overlap with other Laws; at the same time, it is necessary to analyze more deeply the current situation of network security to clarify the need to develop this Law project.\\n\\nIn addition, the National Assembly Chairman said that regulations related to human rights restriction must also be specified in this Law. Regarding regulations such as the national important information system, they should be more specific, avoiding generalities.\\n\\nNational Assembly Vice Chairman Uong Chu Luu said: This law relates to many promulgated legal documents such as the Criminal Code, the Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200bInformation Security, the Basic Law, the Law on Science and Technology, and the Law on Technology. information… Therefore, it is necessary to carefully review the regulations to avoid overlapping and duplication. At the same time, it is necessary to clearly define the roles, functions and tasks of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Public Security in the draft Law on cybersecurity.\\n\\nConcluding the discussion, National Assembly Vice Chairman Do Ba Ty said that this is a difficult law project with many complicated contents, so it is necessary to carefully study and select the experiences of other countries to build. The Standing Committee of the National Assembly suggested that the Drafting Committee should absorb the comments, continue to study and complete the Law project, and submit it to the National Assembly for comments at the 4th session of the XIV National Assembly.\"\n",
      " 'At present, reactionary and anti-sabotage elements continue to use distorting statements about the situation of freedom of information, freedom of the Internet, and social networks in Vietnam in order to oppose democracy, incite and divide the world. division in society, creating an excuse for outside forces to interfere in our country. They think that in Vietnam there is no freedom of information, freedom of social networks, social networks are strictly censored...\\nIn Vietnam, social networks began to be introduced in the 2000s in the form of electronic diaries (blogs). To date, there are more than 300 different social networking sites registered and over 76 million social network users. In particular, Facebook is the most popular social network because of its convenient design for users when creating personal accounts, as well as the features of information exchange, expression of feelings, personal views with others. people in the same group, with the same interests... should have attracted many members to join. Following Facebook are My Space pages, Twitter, blogs…\\nWith the operation mechanism of social networks with high interactive nature, \"netizens\" easily share personal information with each other, thus attracting an increasing number of participants, including young people. . This has created advantages for all members when participating in social networks, that is, being able to share as well as find necessary information to serve the individual needs of each person. However, in addition to the official, useful and educational information, there is also unorthodox, untrue, distorting, and advocating for a deviant lifestyle that is also posted on social networks with different purposes. Recently, the situation of using social networks to fraudulently appropriate property, slander, slander, incite, etc., has become increasingly complicated and sophisticated, causing social disorder and affecting prestige. credit, honor and work of cadres, civil servants and public employees in Kon Tum province. Only in the first 6 months of 2022, investigating agencies at all levels of the province discovered 8 cases of property appropriation fraud, of which 5 were carried out via the Internet. In addition, through the work of grasping the situation and recording information on dozens of cases related to crimes of fraud and appropriating property through telecommunications networks, social networks with new and increasingly new methods and tricks. sophisticated, causing great damage to people\\'s property, causing frustration in public opinion...\\nSocial networks have become the leading tool for hostile forces to take advantage of to destroy ideology; increasing the risk of revealing state secrets and social networks, having negative impacts on cultural development and eroding national cultural identity. Therefore, along with the development of social networks, it is necessary to have management to best promote the positive aspects that social networks bring.\\nThe hostile forces have a one-sided view that in Vietnam social networks are suppressed and social networks do not have freedom of information, social network users are not allowed to express their opinions and thoughts. .. This is completely fabricated and untrue information, because our Party and State have always consistently advocated and maintained the policy of respecting and protecting basic human freedoms, including the right to self-determination. by information, Internet freedom. In fact, we have achieved achievements in economic development like today, partly because we make good use of opportunities from the Internet, it is the conditions for the free development of the Internet and social networks that have made an important contribution. important in national construction and development; this was already “an inevitable part” of social classes.\\nThrough social networking sites, people can express their information and opinions; Not only that, there are many agencies and organizations in the political system from the central to local levels that have used the Internet and social networks to work, handle administrative procedures and directly contact the people. .. What is happening every day, every hour in Vietnam has proved that in Vietnam there is no suppression of social networks, but on the contrary, the free development is guaranteed by the Party and State. Exercising the right to freedom of the Internet, social networks are always placed within the legal framework. Thus, ensuring network security, preventing and stopping activities that take advantage of social networks and the Internet to violate Vietnamese law. Accordingly, over the past time, the State of Vietnam has implemented many solutions synchronously, such as: promulgating legal documents (Law on Press 2016; Law on Access to Information 2016; Law on Cybersecurity 2018; Law on Cybersecurity 2018). ; Decree No. 72/2013/ND-CP on management, provision and use of internet services and online information; Decree No. 174/2013/ND-CP stipulating penalties for administrative violations in the postal sector government, telecommunications, information technology and radio frequencies; Regulations on what Party members are not allowed to do...) to carry out the work of detecting, fighting and strictly handling those who take advantage of the Internet. , social networks violate the law. On October 26, 2021, the People\\'s Committee of Kon Tum province issued Document No. 3855/UBND-KGVX requesting provincial departments, agencies and People\\'s Committees of districts and cities to raise awareness,responsibilities of cadres, civil servants and public employees in using social networks… This is completely appropriate and not only in Vietnam but many countries around the world have done so. Even in the US, a country that considers itself a \"free country\", the National Assembly of this country has issued many legal documents to handle and prevent the use of the Internet and social networks to terrorize and incite violence. force or violate intellectual property... Therefore, in Vietnam, there is no repression of social networks, or illegal torture of any blogger. Obviously, behind the fabricated information is a political conspiracy of hostile forces to incite division in the great national unity bloc and deny the leadership role of our Party.\\nRecognizing wrong views that Vietnam has no democracy, human rights, no freedom of speech, freedom of thought, suppression of social networks, and giving scientific arguments to criticize and refute. Those wrong views are necessary. At the same time, through that, we also review ourselves, review the guidelines and guidelines of the Party and the State\\'s policies where they have not been implemented well, and where they are not suitable to step by step perfect, in order to truly bring about positive results. legitimate rights and interests for the People. As President Ho Chi Minh taught: \"... The revolutionary party needs self-criticism and self-criticism just as people need air\", \"Every cadre, every party member, every day must self-criticize and self-reflect. Criticism, self-correction like having to wash your face every day. With that, there will be no diseases in the Party, but the Party will be extremely healthy.”'\n",
      " 'First, it can be affirmed that the Law on Cybersecurity has absolutely no effect on people\\'s right to freedom of speech. There is no law that provides regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals using new network information like this. Never before has children\\'s rights been so protected on online information. The Law on Cybersecurity emphasizes the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations on network information. People are comfortable using the network to do activities that do not violate the law. There is absolutely no provision to impede free speech. Only individuals who give false, fabricated, or insulting information according to 29 articles of the Penal Code will be handled. It is not possible to threaten to kill people online and be free, but in reality, they will be punished; It is impossible to freely buy and sell weapons, explosives, detailed instructions on how to use them, but in real life, they will be handled but not online… Who offends the nation, sovereignty, religion, or who discriminates against gender on the Internet? …will be dealt with.\\n\\n-Is it mandatory for businesses to disclose personal information to security agencies in violation of personal privacy protection?\\n\\n+ Do not violate anything. Because there is article 17 of the Law already. Article 17 is very strict to protect the privacy of individuals and families. \"Enterprises when providing telecommunications services, internet and value-added services... are responsible for verifying information when users register for digital accounts, and keeping user\\'s account information confidential.\" Therefore, it is the responsibility of the business to maintain confidentiality. Failure to do so will be handled.\\n\\n\"Provide information to users in charge of network security protection upon written request to serve the investigation of violations of the law on network security\". In the event that the Law provides so, it will be provided. For example, when I see an online exchange of buying and selling explosives to prepare for terrorism, the involved party must definitely provide information for us to handle, otherwise a disaster will occur.\\n\\nIn addition, information will not be arbitrarily provided and must be treated as confidential. If you reveal that secret, you will be held responsible.\\n\\nRight now a lot of our information is being leaked.\\n\\n-But the sign of violation seems to be very vague, sir?\\n\\n+ No ambiguity. This issue is referred to in 29 articles of the Criminal Law. If we detect signs of a bomb, we have to arrest it immediately. Information must be requested to verify if the person is true or just fabricated information. And after that, we can handle the law or handle it in another form.\\n\\nAnd I believe that when developing this, the Committee on Defense and Security, the Law Committee of the National Assembly reviewed it very carefully.\\n\\n-In the Law, there is a sentence that is quite vague. For example \"insulting great people\". So how to identify \"great man\", sir?\\n\\n+ This must be appraised by relevant functional ministries. If the Ministry replies that there is a violation, we will be handled. For example, related to credit fraud, it is necessary to ask the State Bank and financial economic groups to determine whether there is a violation. There are a lot of people losing money and this has to be verified by a cybersecurity agency. We have to step by step investigate, verify and clarify whether it is subjective, objective, age...\\n\\nOf course, no law is perfect. Someone asked me, \"Does this law prevent acts in cyberspace?\". I replied: \"Criminal Law is enacted, but murder is still there, robbery is still there\". Having a Cybersecurity Law is there to provide scope for what is protected and to know prohibited behavior for us to avoid. Even the agency in charge of cybersecurity must rely on this Law to know what is prohibited and what is allowed.\\n\\n-From now until the decree is formulated, will the editorial board continue to listen to people\\'s opinions, sir?\\n\\n+ The editorial board always listens, always adjusts, always asks for the right content to be submitted. All decrees are commented by agencies, economic groups, and internet telecommunications groups. I affirm so.\\n\\n-During the drafting of the Law on Cybersecurity, did we work with Google…?\\n\\n+ The draft Law on Cybersecurity was developed in November 2016 according to the Resolution of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister then issued a decision to establish a Drafting Committee. Members include many ministries and branches, not only the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Defense, etc. During the construction process, the drafting committee also followed Decree 72 on setting up servers and offices in Vietnam. Then, when submitting the Law on Cybersecurity at the 4th Session of the National Assembly, the National Assembly also asked how to adjust it to suit the recommendations of businesses and internet telecommunications corporations.\\n\\nDuring the drafting process, the drafting board also had the opportunity to approach major telecommunications groups in the world such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, American Business Association, ASEANn.... Thereby to explain and listen to their opinions on our Cybersecurity bill. After the two sides worked and agreed, the representatives of those units agreed towill adjust their strategy accordingly. The corporations themselves, these units also see our adjustments and regulations as appropriate. It is completely unlikely that Google and Facebook will withdraw from the Vietnamese market. And certainly with a market share like that of Vietnam, currently 48 million Facebook accounts and will certainly be larger, so there is no such thing as rumors. There is absolutely no information about this.'\n",

In which, it requires information system owners, enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the Internet and value-added services in cyberspace, agencies, organizations, parents, teachers, caregivers. caregivers and other individuals responsible for protecting children when children participate in cyberspace; requesting the specialized cyber security force to apply necessary measures to protect children\\'s rights in cyberspace.\\n\\n(5) To be protected by a specialized force for cybersecurity protection when participating in activities in cyberspace, when the task force is empowered to take necessary cybersecurity protection measures (Article 5), helping this force operate more effectively and efficiently, which means it will protect national security, social order and safety, and the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.\\n\\n(6) The rights of individuals will be guaranteed when all people are equal before the law. All illegal acts in cyberspace will be handled in accordance with the law. Community responsibility for cybersecurity will be enhanced, when agencies, organizations and enterprises in information system management and service provision in cyberspace are identified with specific responsibilities, contributing to important for the formation of a safe and healthy cyberspace.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity does not control all of citizens\\' personal information.\\n\\nIn the face of serious and complicated illegal activities in cyberspace, it is necessary to ensure the basis and conditions for quick and effective investigation and handling of the law enforcement force. necessary and urgent, including the responsibilities of domestic and foreign service providers.

      " 'Responding to risks and challenges to national security, social order and human rights, the Party and State of Vietnam have adopted policies and laws to ensure internet security, social networks, and create favorable conditions. for agencies, organizations and individuals to exercise their rights. However, on the internet, social networks have people who misrepresent the goals and policies of the Vietnamese Party and State towards the virtual world environment. They believe that Vietnam has amended and introduced recent laws, especially the Law on Cybersecurity, to \"suffocate\" the right to freedom of speech (online); in Vietnam “no internet freedom…”; The goal of \"filtering network information\", including the Prime Minister\\'s request for the early promulgation of the \"Online Code of Conduct\" and the Cybersecurity Law that allows the police to investigate and verify online accounts in violation of the law. breaking the law is a \"violation of the right to privacy\". However, the reality shows that these are just slanderous claims.\\n\\nAs the media reported, on September 23, 2018, the People\\'s Court of Cai Rang district, Can Tho city had a first-instance trial against defendant Nguyen Hong Nguyen for the crime of \"abusing democratic freedoms to invade violate the interests of the State, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals”… (Article 331 of the Penal Code). According to the indictment, Nguyen Hong Nguyen used facebook with the account name \"Nguyen Hong Nguyen\" (pen name Bo Cong Anh). In order to make friends, Nguyen regularly accesses the internet to draft, post, and share on his personal page many articles, photos, and video clips with content defaming and defaming leaders of the Party, State, and President. Ho Chi Minh, distorting the lines and policies of the Party and State, causing bad public opinion in society.\\n\\nOr the People\\'s Court of Nghe An province tried Le Dinh Luong (on August 16, 2018) on charges of operating to overthrow the people\\'s government. According to the indictment of the People\\'s Procuracy of Nghe An province, Le Dinh Luong set up an account on MXH (facebook) to \"like\", respond, and share with other facebook accounts with inciting and enticing content. , attracting many people to Viet Tan to overthrow the people\\'s government. Le Dinh Luong has published many propaganda articles, promoting the terrorist organization Viet Tan; distorting the State\\'s policies and laws, slandering the Communist Party of Vietnam... Le Dinh Luong also took advantage of political, social, economic and environmental events to distort the truth and cause frustration among people. people, against the social system and the State.\\n\\n\\n\\nIllustration: VNA.\\n\\nThe common characteristics of the cases against the social regime, the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in recent times are: In terms of content, the main crimes are distorting policies and laws of the Party and State; blackening the Communist Party of Vietnam, insulting the leaders of the working class (Marx, Engels, Lenin, President Ho Chi Minh); take advantage of complex social problems, polluted environment...; about the foreign policy of \"diversification\", \"multilateralization\" of our Party and State to falsely accuse Vietnam of following this country, leaning towards another country, betraying the interests of the nation... Fish In particular, there are groups of subjects engaged in armed activities, using bombs and mines to cause national insecurity and to overthrow the social regime, such as the case of Dao Minh Quan (crime of \"operating to overthrow the government\". people, by the People\\'s Court of Ho Chi Minh City on August 22, 2018).\\n\\nIn terms of methods, it can be said that all criminals use the internet, social networks, especially facebook to gather, expand their forces, propagate and distort policies and laws of the Party and State... connecting domestic criminals with each other and with organizations and individuals against Vietnam abroad.\\n\\nThe birth of the internet and social media created a leap forward in the development of mankind in this day and age. It can be said that the internet and social media are the basis of the 4.0 technology revolution in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, internet of things, self-driving cars, 3D printing technology, and nanotechnology. .. With the internet, social media, humanity has a new world-virtual world, with a new ecosystem-digital ecosystem. It is a system of information in all fields, and is stored and easily searched on the Internet (Wikipedia page) along with many search engine sites, information exchange, correspondence (Google, Yahoo pages). , You Tube). On these websites, individuals can have online interactions anywhere, anytime.\\n\\nHowever, in the virtual world - the digital ecosystem, it poses many challenges for humanity, the nation and the nation, especially in assessing the authenticity of online information, from simple things like buying online goods (with the right quality, design or not) to issues related to national security (such as the situation in the East Sea, Vietnam-China-US relations...); Socio-economic situation (cases of state agencies granting land use permits);... to privacy rights (male-female relations... marriage, family) are difficult to determine the authenticity of. authenticity of the information we receive or are interested in.\\n\\nIn other words, information in the virtual-online world is difficult to verify. This leads to bad guys who can take advantage of the internet and social networks for evil purposes, such as: Giving sensational informationn to sentence view, sentence like; giving information about private life due to narrow-mindedness, selfishness... Unfortunately, up to now, there are still many people who believe that the digital environment completely belongs to the individual, there is no law; or bad guys think they can use technology to hide their illegal behavior.\\n\\nIn the digital-virtual world, national security, social order and safety, and human rights face new challenges. If in the past national security was to protect the sovereignty of the land, sea, airspace, social regime, etc., today, it is also about protecting cyber security. The content of the law aimed at protecting national sovereignty and cyber security is: It is strictly forbidden to provide information for the purpose of organizing, operating, instigating, enticing and training anti-State people...; strictly prohibit acts of violating social order and safety (such as calling for mass gatherings, causing trouble, organizing gambling, forging websites of agencies, organizations and individuals...; it is strictly forbidden to attack the network (causing a technical crisis to destroy the use of the network)...\\n\\nIn the current context of the internet and social media, respecting and ensuring human rights has certain differences compared to past historical periods. The content of human rights today is broader than before, including the right to use the internet and social media. If in the past, the right to freedom of speech and press (in the group of civil and political rights) only had access to print, audio and video newspapers, today this right also includes the right to access, use the internet, social networks.\\n\\nArticle 25 of the 2013 Constitution of the State of Vietnam stipulates: “Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, access to information, assembly, association, and demonstration. The exercise of these rights is prescribed by law”. Institutionalizing the above regulation, the National Assembly has developed and promulgated many laws, such as the Press Law-2016; Law on Access to Information -2013; Decree of the Government on Management, provision and use of internet services and online information-2013; Law on Cybersecurity-2018…\\n\\nInternational human rights law also stipulates that the right of peoples to self-determination is a collective right of human rights. Article 1 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states: “All peoples have the right to self-determination. Stemming from that right, peoples freely decide their political institutions and freely develop their economy, society and culture”. is the right to choose the social system (socialist or capitalist…) as well as the right of states to decide on the law.\\n\\nWith regard to individual rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contains provisions on limitations of rights. Article 19 (on “the right to hold opinions” and “the right to freedom of expression”) specifically states: “The exercise of these rights “is accompanied by special obligations and responsibilities”, and “may subject to certain restrictions”, to: “(a) Respect the rights or reputation of others; b) Protect national security or public order, health or morals of society”.\\n\\nThus, provisions restricting rights in order to protect national security, public order and individual rights, such as: \"Abusing the provision and use of internet services and online information for the purpose of:\" Against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; Disseminating information that distorts, slanders, offends the reputation of organizations, honors and dignity of individuals; ... (Article 5, Government\\'s Decree on Management, provision and use of internet services and information information on the Internet)… or “Organizing, operating, colluding, instigating, bribing, deceiving, enticing, training, training people against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; distorting history, denying revolutionary achievements, undermining the great unity bloc of the whole nation, insulting religion, discriminating against gender and racism; taking advantage of or abusing network security protection activities to infringe upon the sovereignty, interests, national security, social order and safety, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals, or for personal gain. “ (Article 8 Law on Cybersecurity)… is fully compatible with international human rights law.\\n\\nIn the context of the digital revolution, the subject responsible for national security and human rights is extended to the leadership of international carriers, including Google, Yahoo, Facebook... The carrier is cooperating with the state to remove and block accounts that give false information, contrary to national law.\\n\\nDuring the meeting between Mr. Nguyen Manh Hung (then acting Minister of Information and Communications, now Minister of Information and Communications) and Mr. Simon Milner, Vice President of Public Policy in the region Asia-Pacific by facebook (September 14, 2018), both sides understand each other and express their goodwill. Mr. Nguyen Manh Hung wishes that “Vietnam and Facebook should become friends, for the prosperity of both sides.”[1]. Mr. Simon Milner also joked about the affection and responsibility of facebook: \"In some countries, we are just one of the brides, but here we are the chief bride\" and he pledged to \"cooperate closely\" chwill work with the Government of Vietnam to thoroughly resolve outstanding issues through the formation of a joint working group with Vietnam.”[2].\\n\\nThus, it can be said that all laws of the State of Vietnam as well as of other countries in the world protect the political regime and the state on the one hand, and on the other hand ensure human rights, public rights, and human rights. people. Without protecting the existing social system and state, it also fails to protect human rights, rights and interests of citizens.'\n",
      " 'Today, the rapid development of the internet has positively impacted the development of economy, education, health, culture, society, ... in many countries. However, the activities of many people when using the internet pose risks, directly threatening national sovereignty, order and security, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. This phenomenon occurs because the development of the internet has created a \"fertile ground\" for a new type of criminal operating in the cyber environment, using social networks as a means and tool to carry out personal intrigues. dark or illegal acts, causing severe consequences to many aspects of life. Especially, cyber attacks targeting security, defense, economy and culture in many countries are on the rise. With many sophisticated tricks, these subjects used high technology to spread malicious code to invade, attack the data system of the state headquarters; At the same time, from negative and dark motives, some organizations and individuals thoroughly exploit social networks to fabricate, distort, slander, spread fake news, etc. In the face of that fact, the issue of protecting national security and protecting the rights and interests of everyone in cyberspace has been concerned by many countries. attention, and has become a global issue.\\n\\nAccording to recent United Nations statistics, there are currently 138 countries in the world that have enacted Cybersecurity Laws. Notably, in the past six years, 23 countries have enacted more than 40 legal documents and laws on cybersecurity. Although the names may vary from country to country, these laws have the common goal of creating a legal basis to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all citizens, as well as the activities of public authorities. organizations and businesses in the internet environment. At the same time, along with establishing regulations to help regulate behavior in cyberspace, the law also clearly stipulates sanctions to sanction cyber-security violations.\\n\\nVietnam and Southeast Asian countries are considered as dynamic countries with a high speed of developing internet applications, but they are also suffering heavy damage from attacks by criminals. implementation network. Specifically, in October 2017, the leak of personal information of 46 million mobile subscribers (regarding home addresses, national identification card numbers, SIM card information, ...) in Malaysia- sia has created a great shock in community life. According to experts, this risk has been warned since 2014. However, when it occurs in reality, the seriousness of the problem is fully realized. As for Singapore, in 2017 alone, the country suffered three major cyber attacks, in which hackers attacked the entire network of the Ministry of Defense. In 2018, Singapore continued to suffer a lot of damage caused by cybercrime, typically when hackers stole personal information of 1.5 million people.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, on October 30, 2019, the Department of Information Security (Ministry of Information and Communications) issued a coordination order requesting agencies, organizations and businesses to urgently scan and remove the files. malicious code information of a large-scale targeted attack campaign (APT) targeting Government agencies and important information infrastructure of Vietnam. More than 400,000 IP addresses were infected with more than 16 variants of malware in this attack. According to a recent report by CyStack Company (operating in the field of network security), in 2019 there were more than 560,000 attacks on websites globally, and Vietnam ranked 11th among countries with many websites. hacked around the world with more than 9,300 compromised websites. A series of such incidents shows that the protection of network security has become extremely urgent and global.\\n\\nIn the past 5 years, many Southeast Asian countries have enacted the Law on Cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Law of Singapore, issued in 2017, allows the Cybersecurity Agency of this country to monitor and manage the country\\'s cyber security. In January 2018, the Ministry of Law of Singapore issued a press release on the development of a new bill to combat the spread of fake news, under which the government will be given absolute power to control the spread of fake news. control all information on social networks and severely punish violating individuals and organizations. In February 2019, Thailand also officially passed the Cybersecurity Law. Accordingly, the National Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity Committee was established, in charge of the Prime Minister. Notably, Thailand\\'s Cybersecurity Law stipulates that in critical situations (such as a serious cybersecurity threat) competent authorities are allowed to ignore court orders.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, the Law on Cybersecurity (regulations on activities to protect national security and ensure social order and safety in cyberspace; responsibilities of relevant agencies, organizations and individuals) approved by the National Assembly on June 12, 2018, and took effect from January 1, 2019. After one year of implementation, the Law has played an active role ing the implementation of measures to protect network safety and security, promptly prevent and handle violations of the law on network security. In 2019, about 8,000 videos with malicious content, hundreds of fake accounts, thousands of illegal sales and advertising links were removed. Many cases of using social networks to incite national hatred, call for protests against the government, and distort the lines, guidelines and policies of the Party and State... have been detected and handled appropriately. . People\\'s awareness has been gradually raised. There are individuals who have previously loudly protested and attacked the Law on Cybersecurity, saying that the Law violates human rights, hinders democratic freedom and freedom of expression, but when they themselves become victims of crimes If they commit crimes online, these individuals are aware of the importance of the Law and must ask the authorities to intervene to protect themselves. In fact, the Law on Cybersecurity shows that people are not prevented from free speech, but they are free to express their opinions on social networking sites within the framework of the law, especially when their That idea towards protecting the community\\'s interests, condemning negative behavior on social networks will be responded by the online community and have a strong pervasive effect. As a result, the situation of information disturbance in cyberspace has been gradually rectified, helping people to access healthy and useful information every day.\\n\\nRecently, a topical issue that has attracted many people\\'s attention is the situation of the Covid-19 epidemic. As of February 21, 2020, while the number of infected people in Vietnam is 16, over 170 individuals have been handled for posting false information about the epidemic on social networks, including: including celebrities. The timely and resolute handling of the authorities has been approved and supported by the public. Because the epidemic is not scary, if we stay awake and calm, fully equipped with knowledge and skills to prevent and treat the disease and take it seriously, the scary thing is believing in false and misleading information online. society, with the purpose of spreading confusion, fear, inciting negative behavior in the community. At the same time, thanks to the Law on Cybersecurity with the final entry of the relevant authorities and authorities, fraudulent acts on social networks such as taking advantage of the epidemic to increase prices, counterfeiting, etc. .. the medical equipment was also handled in a timely manner. By February 19, 2020, the authorities had handled more than 30,000 online (online) stores with nearly 48,000 infringing products. Before the determination of the authorities, many e-commerce sites with fraudulent behavior have automatically closed or adjusted their behavior.\\n\\nThe specific examples mentioned above have partly shown that when coming to life, the Law on Cybersecurity has played an important role in protecting people\\'s legitimate rights, maintaining social order, and protecting social security. national security in the internet environment. To further supplement and support the Law on Cybersecurity, on February 3, 2020, the Prime Minister signed and promulgated Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP (effective from April 15, 2020). ) prescribes penalties for administrative violations in the fields of post, telecommunications, radio frequencies, information technology and electronic transactions. According to legal experts, along with the Law on Cybersecurity, the Decree will help promote more strongly the role of the law in general and the law on cybersecurity in particular, in detecting, preventing, handling violations in cyberspace. The beneficiaries are the people and agencies, organizations, enterprises, etc., on that basis, contribute to the protection of social order and safety.\\n\\nHowever, it should be seen that, in order for legal documents to really play their role in practice, besides the participation of the political system, it is also necessary for the cooperation and companionship of all people, expressed by consciously complying with the law when participating in social networks, be cautious and alert before unverified information, promptly detect signs of fraud, fraud or false information to warn the community, promptly report report to authorities. That is a practical way for each person to protect themselves, contribute to protecting the healthy development of cyberspace, and protect the peace and development of the country. In particular, it should be recognized that this is not only a separate issue posed by the State of Vietnam, but all countries have specific laws to manage and handle all violations.'\n",
      " 'Many organizations and individuals voiced their responses in the name of international and non-governmental organizations, but this digital identity is not difficult to recognize. For example, Freedom House said that \"Vietnam continues to be an enemy of Internet freedom\" when it comes to the Law on Cybersecurity, giving many \"stormy\" views. So who is Freedom House, see the background to know the \"familiarity\".\\nFreedom House (ie \"free house\") is a non-governmental organization, established in October 1941, headquartered in the United States. The organization assigns itself the mission of \"monitoring the process of global democratization, surveying and studying the implementation of political and civil liberties in countries around the world\".\\nFreedom House also claims to be “a transparent voice for democracy and freedom in the world”! To demonstrate its mission, every year Freedom House publishes documents called reports on freedom in the world, annual reports on press freedom and Internet freedom. Worth mentioning, out of more than 200 countries and territories around the world, Freedom House chooses its own list to survey.\\n\\nMany people took to the streets to gather and cause trouble due to the impact of provocative information\\non social networks.\\n \\nMany times, in its report on \"world freedom\", \"freedom of the press\", \"internet freedom\", Freedom House continues to consider Vietnam as a \"non-free\" country in the exercise of political freedom. administrative and civil.\\nSince its inception, Freedom House has been a propaganda machine created by the late President Roosevelt to prepare the American public for America\\'s entry into the war in World War II. However, after the end of the second world war, Freedom House was not dissolved, but continued to be used to conduct propaganda campaigns, advocate for the Marshall Plan and NATO, and propagate propaganda. against Communism.\\nIt is a fact that until now, most of Freedom House\\'s operating funds are funded by the US Government, so it has become a tool of those who have spent money to operate under the guise of research, monitoring, promote freedom, democracy, human rights...\\nTherefore, the information that Freedom House gives about Internet freedom is imposed by bad ideas and intentions. Recently, Freedom House\\'s 2017 Internet Freedom report in the United States said that Vietnam continues to \"sink deeper into the group of countries without Internet freedom\". They ranked Vietnam 7th, after China, Cuba... and depicted on the map with gray bars, indicating that the country has not changed in terms of Internet freedom.\\nThe way Freedom House does it is similar to Human Rights Watch (HRW), which is to turn yes into no, no into yes, using lies to slander. Like Freedom House, every year HRW repeats its misrepresentation, accusing Vietnam of suppressing the right to freedom of speech, association, freedom of the press, and the Internet.\\nThe characters that HRW cited for so-called \"repression of human rights\" also echo the list that Freedom House uses if the number of \"democrats and human rights activists\" is active in anti-social media channels. spread on the Internet. Supporting and accompanying Freedom House, HRW, there are many websites, newspapers, magazines, radio stations and press organizations such as Southeast Asia Press Alliance (Seapa), Reporters Without Borders Organization Reporters sans frontières (RSF)...\\nIn their annual reports and reports, these organizations make false statements and assessments that the Vietnamese State violates freedom of the press, the Internet, suppresses the press, suppresses bloggers, and then deliberately ranks Vietnam Nam is on the list of countries with extremely low rankings in terms of freedom of the press, speech, and Internet... HRW, Freedom House cites cases of imprisonment and criminal punishment when taking advantage of the internet to commit crimes. offense.\\nThe annual \"Press Freedom Index\" report of Reporters Without Borders said that freedom of the press and the Internet in Vietnam \"has not shown any signs of improvement\", people \"are not allowed to freely due to access to information” and Vietnam has become “the world’s second largest prisoner of bloggers and netizens”. Similar to the guise of Freedom House, together with the publication of the report, RSF took advantage of a number of media outlets that lack sympathy for Vietnam and are hostile to Vietnam to give interviews \"to deepen the understanding of Vietnam.\" than” this report.\\nBorn in 1985 in France, from the very beginning, RSF gave itself the right to promote freedom of the press and freedom of expression in the Western style. RSF is a name with no face that often distorts and distorts the situation of press freedom in Vietnam. Their way of doing things is also like no other, it is based on denunciations or articles of law-breaking objects and then chained and put on a list of condemnation of violations of freedom of the press, internet, and speech.\\nIn fact, RSF operates not in the interests of journalists, who have been denounced in many countries. This organization is also accused of receiving a lot of support from American billionaire George Soros, who has supported the Solidarnosc union with millions of dollars, from the National Endowment for Democracy - an organization. 90% of the budget comes from the national budget of the US and belongs to the US Department of Stateey”.\\nBecause of such financial dependence, RSF, Freedom House, HRW... all have the same motive and purpose of action. Therefore, until the next appointment, their reports and reports list dozens and hundreds of countries and territories around the world to evaluate \"in their own way\", thereby criticizing, only to the governments of the countries.\\nTherefore, it is not surprising that when the National Assembly passed the bill, RSF immediately called for \"revoking the Cybersecurity Law\". Daniel Bastard, head of RSF\\'s Asia-Pacific office, said: \"We ask Vietnamese lawmakers to revoke this harsh new law, which has been instrumental in strengthening control. government for access to information”. “We also ask online service companies not to give in to the unacceptable threats posed by this law” he threatened!\\nObviously, the truth of those of RSF, Freedom House, HRW... has been revealed for a long time, the same guise, tricks of fraud, deception and slander as before, although today\\'s trend has changed a lot.\\nAlong with such organizations, many individuals at home and abroad also have the opportunity to \"condemn\" the issue of cybersecurity, criticize the National Assembly and the State of Vietnam. It can be clearly seen that those who commit illegal acts, taking advantage of cyberspace to destroy the country, have been handled by the authorities in various forms.\\nThis number has long used the Internet to write defamatory propaganda articles, in the name of \"civil society\", \"democracy and human rights\", \"defense of the Fatherland\"... to form associations and groups with the name. Calls, slogans, principles, and purposes are easy to impress with the needs and tastes of certain classes and social sectors such as \"Civil Society Forum\", \"Prisoners of Conscience Association\", \"Association of Prisoners of Conscience\". Association of Women for Human Rights\", \"Association for Mutual Friendship\", \"Association of Independent Journalists\"...\\nTheir tricks are through websites, online forums, especially social networks to openly organize, propagate, deceive, entice people to participate, and use security software to communicate. , organize online training and training for the number of members, openly write petitions, demand the establishment of an opposition political party, request the establishment of an association or group, and demand lawsuits, slander, and misrepresentation of the State. We violate international treaties on civil rights…\\nObjects take advantage of loopholes in the law, negative issues, democracy, human rights, ethnicity and religion in the country to propagate, distort and plot to form and publicize organizations political opposition in Vietnam. Others are now following this thought and point of view, promoting and defending illegal acts of what they call \"dissidents\" such as: Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, Nguyen Van Hai, Nguyen Van Dai, Dinh Nguyen Kha, Nguyen Phuong Uyen, Ta Phong Tan, Dinh Nhat Uy, Truong Minh Tam, Chu Manh Son...\\nWith cyber security, a regulating law, directly affecting cyberspace - where the forces, organizations and individuals as cited above use as effective tools against Vietnam are like leeches. right lime, they react violently.\\nThe problem is that we - the people who live and protect this regime, this country and this people must understand it properly, know the difference between right and wrong. But if you keep seeing people talking online, swearing online, saying that this law is nothing, this law covers the regime, pulls back history, this law strengthens dictatorship, is totalitarian... I don\\'t know if the crab\\'s head is narrow, so it\\'s dangerous to join in.\\nSeen as it is, the current joining in like the wind in bamboo houses on facebook, blogs, and online forums is scary. How many people have read the bill, then when the National Assembly passed it, they saw every word in the law and saw the Internet swearing, they also joined in cursing, then shared articles, clips, mocking graphics everywhere, as if I enjoy something very good, but I don\\'t know that it is a help to sow disaster, but first of all, it is in myself before talking about the disaster in people, the disaster for society and the country.'\n",

However, the work of ensuring information safety and security has not been paid enough attention and investment. This has made media outlets frequently targeted by hackers. According to statistics in 2020, there were 156 attacks by 8 APT groups (should be explained) targeting organizations in Vietnam, of which the target audience is press and media agencies, accounting for 21% of the total number of attacks. attack.\\nCyberattacks on press and media agencies will cause very serious and dangerous consequences, because this is the direct media agency, the extension arm of the Party, directly propagandizing and disseminating information. change the guidelines and lines of the Party, policies and laws of the State, ideological orientation, public opinion and criticism of public opinion, especially for the revolutionary press when performing the task of protecting the foundation. ideology of the Party, fight against wrong and hostile views.\\n\\nWhen a press - media agency is attacked by hackers, it will lead to slow access speed or even system stagnation; Worse, the entire database will be stolen, deleted, the content changed with \"reactionary\" and \"false\" content. As a result, the international and regional recognition and assessment of the Party and State\\'s policies and guidelines is erroneous; Social public opinion is turned upside down, adversely affecting socio-economic development, strengthening national defense and security, even stronger is losing national sovereignty, losing the socialist regime, lighter, the prestige of the agency Press authority will be affected, people\\'s trust in the newspaper will decline. The stolen data will be used to exploit the truth or for other dark purposes. Altered or deleted data will make it very difficult for the governing body to return the system to normal operation.\\n\\nSome cyberattacks that have had a big impact in Vietnam in recent times include:\\n\\nVietNamNet newspaper suffered a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack: In early 2011, VietNamNet newspaper suffered a DDOS attack on an unprecedented scale in Vietnam. The attack came from a network. giant caused tens of thousands of computers to be infected with viruses and take control. These computers simultaneously access the domain vietnamnet.vn, leading to the phenomenon of network bandwidth being overloaded, readers accessing Report VietNamNet will be network congested and error not found server.\\n\\nVietnam Airlines was attacked by hackers: In July 2016, there was an APT attack on VietnamAriline airline. The attacker displayed offensive images and content against Vietnam and the Philippines, distorting the South China Sea issue on airport screens.Noi Bai International Airport and Tan Son Nhat International Airport. At the same time, the radio system at the airport broadcast similar messages.\\n\\nAs a result of the attack, 100 flights were delayed, the information of more than 400,000 passengers was stolen and distributed online.\\n\\nIn early May 2020, the website of the Department of Home Affairs of Hai Duong province sonoivu.haiduong.gov.vn was attacked by hackers, posting an article with the content of instructions on playing gambling games.\\n\\nIt can be seen that websites, press agencies and media are increasingly becoming \"favorite\" targets of hackers with many different purposes, including political purposes. Imagine, our revolutionary press, with the task of protecting the ideological foundation of the Party, fighting against false and hostile views; is a means of propagating, disseminating and raising awareness for cadres, party members and people of all walks of life when being attacked by cyber attacks, having data stolen, changing or editing propaganda-oriented content. , guidelines, policies, ... then what will be the consequences. Therefore, it is very necessary to strengthen technical and technological solutions in ensuring information security and safety.\\n\\nThe work of ensuring information security and safety for the system of press agencies in Vietnam today\\nCommand 86, on the basis of its functions and tasks, regularly supports agencies, units and organizations inside and outside the Army in overcoming information insecurity incidents; supporting the implementation of measures to ensure information security for key national systems, giving good play to the role of forces protecting national sovereignty in cyberspace.\\n\\nIn fact, checking at an important state-owned press agency, the results show that in most press and media agencies, the work of ensuring information security has not kept up with the speed of digital transformation. , from which there are many risks of being attacked by hackers. The management of connection of personal and professional computers is not tight. Personal computers can connect to the internal network of the office and then connect to the Internet and vice versa. Using USB is not secure. The number of infected personal computers accounts for about 7.5%. The number of computers using copyrighted crack software accounts for more than 24%. About 3.5% of machines have queries to malicious domains or remote control servers. Service servers are not regularly updated, with nearly 90% of servers having security holes, including serious security holes that allow hackers to escalate privileges and take control of the system.\\n\\nIn addition to news agencies and newspapers, important Party and State agencies (offices) often become targets of attacks by foreign hacker groups with the aim of stealing important information. important. Reality has proven this. Many important agencies and units also have many computers to work regularly containing documents and plans to connect regularly on the internet. This is an ideal target for hackers. In many cases, hackers have directly attacked the server system of anti-virus software, disabled the software, and then continued to install malicious code that scans the network, backdoors, and exploits vulnerabilities. vulnerabilities as well as spyware that collects network information, screenshots. For example, the Mustang Panda group regularly attacks the networks of agencies in Mongolia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Myanmar, Germany, the US, Singapore, traces of this group are also often discovered at state agencies. They use decoy files that are documents named Form_, Report, Directive, Plan, etc. In particular, they also take advantage of events that attract a lot of community interest, such as the Covid pandemic. -19 to spread malicious code via email. After entering the network, the malicious code will spread through email and removable storage devices (USB, portable hard drive, ...). The purpose of the attack is to get information about drives, find files, open files, get file information, write files, etc. to send them to the domain name server they have registered before.\\n\\nIt can be seen that the attack behavior of hackers is highly organized and increasingly sophisticated. Therefore, in order to ensure information security and safety for key information systems, including the press system to protect the Party\\'s revolutionary ideological foundation, it is necessary to have technical solutions that bring information about the Party\\'s revolutionary ideology. uniformity, serious and thorough implementation.\\n\\nTo ensure the safe operation of the information technology (IT) system of the press agencies, the following technical solutions should be well implemented:\\n\\n- It is very necessary to establish professional networks that are internal networks, not Internet-connected networks, and use measures to exchange data securely via CDROM, one-way transmission systems...\\n\\n- The computers of press agency officials on business trips should be fully installed with copyrighted and fully updated anti-virus software. Documents that should not be abused are sent via free email systems such as gmail. When necessary, temporarily use password encryption and send the password via SMS.\\n\\n- Carry outperiodically check information security of the IT system, early detect information insecurity risks to handle before being attacked. Regularly update the system, ensure timely patching of security holes, do not let hackers exploit.\\n\\n- Limit the use of external storage devices. When it is necessary to use a CD/DVD drive to back up data, absolutely do not use a regular USB, which helps to limit dynamic code from automatically spreading in the network.\\n\\n- Deploy AD (Active Directory) solution to manage permissions and access to network resources for user accounts in the network.\\n\\n- Deploy centralized network monitoring solutions to detect and give warnings about the risk of losing information security at the earliest. Currently, the network monitoring system built and developed by the 86th Command has been effectively deployed in many important national agencies. This is a comprehensive monitoring system, integrated with many modern monitoring technologies, capable of automatically detecting and responding to stages of an APT attack based on the MITER ATT&CK model. In addition, with trap technology, the system has the ability to create a fake environment to attract attackers, for the purposes of research and analysis of hacker activities and behaviors to the system. In fact, the system is capable of detecting early signs of insecurity and taking timely interventions in support of agencies and units to ensure information security.\\n\\nWith the development of technology, the rapid process of digital transformation, information gradually becomes a central element of development. Press and media organizations are becoming the main targets of cybercriminals. Strengthening security and information safety for press agencies is extremely necessary, especially for the press system to protect the ideological foundation of the Party.'\n",

The Vietnamese press plays an important role in protecting the social interests and freedoms of the people, contributing to the inspection and supervision of the implementation of policies and laws of the State. In recent years, the press has played a very important role in detecting and fighting corruption and negativity as well as in conveying public, transparent and timely information on hot issues of the country. Currently, the typical example is ensuring accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 to all people, creating consensus in society in efforts to prevent the epidemic.

In mid-February 2020, about 200 Hindus in India held an event to drink cow urine in the capital New Delhi, believing it could cure Covid-19. In France, at that time, the Ministry of Health of this country posted a statement denying information online that \"cocaine can cure Covid-19\".\\n\\nWhen Covid-19 first broke out, fake information about this disease flooded all social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube… United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres warned that we were living in \"another world\". pandemic of disinformation\", and stressed that \"our enemy is the continuing proliferation of disinformation\".\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that there is an \"infodemic\" (short for \"information pandemic\", or \"information pandemic\") and he called fake news \"fake news\". The “second disease” coexists with Covid-19.\\n\\nCheck the source\\n\\nWith social networks, each account holder can be a journalist, news publisher. Although these news are transmitted very simply, they meet the criteria quickly, satisfying the needs of readers to access current news. Social networks not only help journalists discover a lot of hot news, good news, suggest many good topics, but also a channel to spread journalistic works to readers.\\n\\nCurrently, most press agencies have set up their own Facebook and YouTube pages to reach the public. Even with the characteristics of producing many programs, TV stations also own many social networking sites, each program is a different social network account.\\n\\nThe problem is that sharing information on social networks only takes a few seconds, but spreading fake news and unverified news causes unpredictable consequences.\\n\\nGraphics: MAI ANH\\nGraphics: MAI ANH\\nInformation can be verified in many ways.

Similarity and repetition are important in how and what we remember. So, when repeatedly seeing false information or conspiracy theories online, and then seeing many major newspapers mentioning it with explanations as to why it is not true, the brain starts to struggle. This is not to say that newsrooms should not expose false news, but should be cautious about how they do it.\\n\\nWe need to learn from these examples of the need to take disinformation seriously. Newsrooms need to work together to push out consistent messages around misinformation. It is necessary to write responsible headlines, not use SEO (Search Engine Optimization) tricks that result in more power for rumors.\\n\\nDr. Nguyen Sy Dung, former Deputy Chairman of the Office of the National Assembly, said that there are two basic patterns in policy responses to fake news - soft response and hard response. The soft response is to use traditional legal systems, incentive systems and technical solutions to combat fake news. These methods have little impact on freedom of speech and expression; facilitate social debate; capture the society\\'s reaction to the State\\'s policies more easily and accurately. However, this approach is difficult and expensive to combat fake news in specific contexts.\\n\\nThe hard response is to enact specialized legislation to combat fake news; attach importance to the State\\'s involvement in combating fake news. This approach creates a higher deterrent against fake news. If the public power apparatus is honest, the anti-fake news will be highly effective. However, the abuse of power in a hard way can affect the right to freedom of speech, freedom of expression; Social debate can be more difficult.\\n\\nIn fact, ensuring network security is an urgent global issue. Currently, about 140 countries have enacted laws, regulations or have strong measures to enhance cybersecurity.\\n\\nIn addition to the Law on Cybersecurity, the Government of Vietnam has issued Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP, effective from April 15, 2020, clearly stipulating the level of administrative penalties for administrative violations. spreading fake information, causing panic on social networks. Accordingly, acts of taking advantage of social networks to provide and share fake information, false information, distort, slander, fabricate will be fined from 10-20 million.\\n\\nIn terms of criminality, those who spread rumors and fake news with bad motives, causing consequences may be considered for criminal prosecution according to the crimes in the 2015 Penal Code. Specifically, the crimes: slander ( article 156); crime of illegally giving or using information on computer networks or telecommunications networks (article 288); crimes of abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State and the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals (article 331).'\n",

The consequences are even greater when the information is ambiguous, the inference is groundless, the source is unclear and difficult to verify specifically, while the units and authorities themselves are slow to respond to official handling, not transparently. information, not actively disclosing necessary information. Therefore, information security becomes more and more urgent in the context of the explosive revolution in communication technology, the Internet of Things and social networks, increasing global connectivity, and automatically connecting computer systems. increasingly intervening in financial and investment activities in the world; at the same time there is an increase in requirements for disclosure, transparency and democratization of information in an open and civilized society.\\n\\nNot only the outbursts of information, stemming from misunderstandings, many negative information are fabricated and released at sensitive times, which has caused confusion and eroded confidence in society, pushing people and Investors deploy safety plans for their assets, without unknowingly knowing that they are abetting the profiteers.

      " 'In the context of deepening international integration and the strong development of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, especially information technology, the internet has become a new social space - \"cyberspace\". . This is a concept used recently in Vietnam; is understood as \"the interconnection network of information technology infrastructure, including telecommunications network, Internet, computer network, information system, information processing and control system, database ; is a place where people perform social behaviors that are not limited by space and time”. The basic characteristics of cyberspace are: transmission speed, fast information search, huge information storage; community cohesion, borderless, multimedia, highly interactive; is a constituent part of society, covering all aspects of social life, bringing new opportunities and opportunities for nations and peoples to cooperate and develop. The positives and negatives of cyberspace are complex. Information on cyberspace is confusing, inaccurate, difficult to verify and control, negatively impacting community culture; increasing the risk of revealing state secrets; decline in state power and national power. At the same time, being a leading tool for hostile forces to take advantage of sabotage; a “fertile” environment for terrorist organizations, criminals to operate, etc.\\n\\nTaking advantage of that advantage, hostile forces, reactionaries and bad elements have been thoroughly exploiting the pervasiveness to carry out a \"communication revolution\" to introduce malicious, fake information, images of pornographic images, inciting violence, calling for the formation of illegal groups, opposition political forces working to counterbalance the Party; propagating Western pragmatic lifestyles, enjoyment, inciting national hatred; smear the prestige of the Party and State leaders. Especially, during the last 13th Party Congress, they used thousands of websites, blogs, hundreds of magazines, newspapers, publishers and radio stations with Vietnamese programs to promote campaigns. distorting and destructive information about ideas; distort documents submitted to the Congress and the Party\\'s personnel work; incitement, internal division, formation of opposition political organizations, in order to destabilize political security, social order and safety in our country. Their purpose is to transform and change political perception, not distinguishing between true and false information, gradually believing in fake and malicious information leading to loss of faith in life, away from the truth. leadership and direction of the Party and State.\\n\\nRecognizing the importance and urgency of protecting the Fatherland in cyberspace, on July 25, 2018, our Party issued a Resolution on \"Strategy to defend the Fatherland in cyberspace\" and a Resolution on \"Strategy to protect the Fatherland in cyberspace\". National Cybersecurity”. The Party\\'s strategy to protect the Fatherland in cyberspace clearly states: “Building a safe, healthy and widespread national cyberspace, creating favorable conditions for economic development; building, developing and protecting Vietnamese culture in cyberspace”2. Our army\\'s task of defending the Fatherland in cyberspace is to perform the task in a new combat environment, with a new method and form of war - \"without gun smoke\". That objectively promotes, creates new opportunities and advantages, but also poses challenges to the task of educating the sense of national defense in cyberspace in the Army. The basic requirement of education is to strengthen and raise awareness, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and determination to defend the Fatherland in cyberspace for all cadres and soldiers, contributing to the accomplishment of the mission. the task of protecting sovereignty, cyber security and the ideological foundation of the Party, defending the Fatherland in cyberspace.\\n\\nTo do that, it is necessary to do some basic contents and measures:\\n\\nFirstly, to strengthen education on the task of protecting the Fatherland in cyberspace for Army officers and soldiers. Thoroughly grasp and well implement the Party\\'s directives and resolutions, the State\\'s legal documents, the Central Military Commission, and the Ministry of National Defense on political, moral and legal education throughout the army, especially in the military.

It is necessary to review, adjust and develop educational contents and programs suitable to the situation and tasks of the Army. In which, priority is given to the contents of building political bravery, will and determination, moral qualities, style and lifestyle; sense of observance of State law and military discipline; ethical, cultural, social knowledge, self-defense ability and skills to prevent and combat malicious information on social networks.

Here, it is necessary to pay special attention to two basic struggles that are closely related to each other: first, actively, actively fighting and criticizing, rejecting wrong and hostile views, and protecting the private foundation. ideology of the Party, raising the sense of national defense; Second, fight for the protection of sovereignty, safety and security in cyberspace to educate and raise the sense of national defense in cyberspace in the Army. In order to carry out the above two directions of struggle, it is necessary to actively and proactively grasp the situation, early detect the object\\'s sabotage activities to fight and defeat their plots and tricks. Promote the synergy, roles and responsibilities of organizations and forces; closely coordinate with relevant agencies, departments and sectors to step up the fight against false and hostile views and claims of hostile objects and opportunistic elements on social networks.'\n",
      " 'Up to now, no one dares to doubt the power of Facebook or Youtube with every daily activity. Even the Vietnam Journalists Association has to issue a rule on the use of social networks by Vietnamese journalists, proving that professional journalists must also be wary of the influence of hundreds of thousands of purple information in space. virtual.\\n\\nTwo important elements of technology that have divided the right to information for everyone are decentralization and delegitimization. With social networks, an individual in a remote area is equivalent to an individual in an urban area in terms of the ability to receive information as well as transmit information. In other words, with just one Facebook account, everyone is as majestic as… \"Editor-in-Chief\" of a newspaper with his own dignity. However, that utility of social networks creates many consequences for mainstream newspapers!.\\n\\n\\nSocial media is dominating our lives.\\nMainstream newspapers must accept a rigorous due diligence process before publishing an information, while social networks are easy to accept rumors. Therefore, two states arose, the mainstream newspapers were racing against social networks, and at the same time, the mainstream newspapers were also harassed by social networks. Undeniably, social networks are very responsive and very diverse.\\n\\nHowever, social networks also contain both one-sidedness and extremism. The frequent and dense connection of social networks creates chain effects that are difficult to predict and difficult to control. Social networks help mainstream newspapers get important \"keywords\" to capture reader trends, but social networks also push mainstream newspapers into a passive position when spreading more false information than real, much bad. than good.\\n\\nThere are famous Facebook players who have a following of several hundred thousand, much higher than the circulation of a daily newspaper. Therefore, the competition between them and the mainstream press has promoted the information to be updated more continuously, more accurately, more deeply.\\n\\nIn fact, there are many professional journalists who have changed their careers, considering Facebook as their main forum. The smartphone is ubiquitous, causing readers to search for information on social networks instead of buying and reading newspapers. As a result of that calculated and cunning selection, the mainstream newspaper lost both in terms of distribution market and advertising revenue.\\n\\nThe clever algorithms of Facebook and Youtube have conquered many businesses and brands, providing a complete database of existing and potential customers compatible with each product. The mainstream newspaper will certainly fail before the social network, if it does not convert appropriately according to the utility of technology, but only hopes for loyal readers to print newspapers. Are mainstream newspapers afraid of social media? Yes! Facebook and Youtube not only acquire advertising revenue, but also have a comfortable margin for uncensored information. To keep its position in the hearts of readers, mainstream newspapers must improve the quality of information, make it more useful, and make it more attractive.\\n\\nThe advantage of mainstream newspapers lies in professional journalists, with a talent for analyzing information as well as a talent for expressing information. Specifically, mainstream newspapers must rise above social networks not by information about what has happened or what is happening, but by communicating what will happen, what needs to happen. That bravery, the \"Editor-in-Chief\" of the newspaper… Facebook can\\'t have!\\n\\nIn the midst of the competition between mainstream newspapers and social networks, another obvious beneficiary is electronic news sites. Neither mainstream newspapers nor social networks, electronic news sites reconcile both information platforms to exist ironically.\\n\\nIn the journey of national press planning, many opinions have warned about the spreading activities of electronic magazines. However, e-magazines also have a governing body to manage, and electronic news sites are diverse, but the Press Department or the Departments of Information and Communications have not had any effective solutions to establish. quiet. There are websites that also set up specialized committees, also send official letters to threaten economic units, also send advertising invitations and also issue Correspondent Cards to work as a major press agency. regulation.\\n\\nThere is a joint-stock company that has used the finance of a venture capital fund to organize many websites that dominate the market, but the ordinary public thinks they are a media corporation. When the Constitution prohibits the privatization of the press, the appearance of such joint stock companies is really a question that makes professional journalists wonder!\\n\\n\\nThe work won the Vietnam Press Caricature Award!\\nHaving a website seems too simple. Just set up a company, apply for a website registration, and innocently make a fake newspaper. The most ingenious way is to think of a website name and then name a similar company to have the opportunity to practice journalism.\\n\\nFor example, the website Sao Viet is proud on the internet, because it is owned by the Russian companyOh Sao Viet. The more I find out, the more funny it is, there are companies that register many business lines but have no commercial activities or services, other than… implementing an electronic news site following the model of a genuine newspaper. Because there is no governing body and no quality monitoring, websites rush to cheap hookups, with information such as actor X revealing underwear or singer Y being jealous.\\n\\nArtists are afraid of electronic news sites because they are ready to \"new\" their models to their colleagues, or carelessly add salt and salt to show biz conflicts. Business people are also afraid of electronic news sites because they do not need morality or self-respect, but only aim to \"make it worse for money\".\\n\\nHow to solve that mess? The company\\'s license is registered at the Department of Planning and Investment, while the website is registered with the Department of Information and Communications, but these two units have little opportunity for inter-sectoral cooperation to check the long distance between the two companies. the purpose of establishing the company and the purpose of setting up the website. Unable to conceal a clear manifestation, it is the electronic information sites that are disturbing the press market. Most cases of impersonating journalists to harass businesses or sensationalize customers come from online news sites. If the national press planning, without measures to sanction electronic news sites, the quality of journalism is still a questionable unknown.\\n\\nCurrently, how many websites are operating as journalism? Perhaps no one can answer, because there are no serious and detailed statistics. Mainstream newspapers and social networks are having an unequal struggle, while electronic news sites are blatantly \"fatty\".\\n\\nHas the benefit that electronic news sites have, have they been exchanged for the notoriety of mainstream newspapers? Readers can only distinguish between mainstream newspapers and social networks, but readers have no way of knowing how arrogant online news sites are wearing official newspapers. Perhaps it\\'s time for regulators to take a more holistic and strict look at websites.\\n\\nBecause, an information in the official newspaper, when obtained through the piracy of electronic news sites, will lead to serious deviations and reliability, and directly cause disturbances to the audience. take. If the Press Law is for mainstream newspapers, and the Cybersecurity Law is for social networks, which law is for electronic news sites? A very small question that many people shy away from'\n",

The issue that the public is most concerned about is what behaviors are prohibited in cyberspace and what people must pay attention to when using social networks when expressing their views so as not to break the law...\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity stipulates six groups of acts that are strictly prohibited in cyberspace. Violators, depending on the nature and severity of their behavior, will be disciplined, administratively handled or examined for penal liability and compensate for the damage caused.\\n\\nAccordingly, prohibited acts on cybersecurity include: using cyberspace, information technology, and electronic means to violate national security, social order and safety, including anti-destructive activities. The State, distorting history, insulting religion, discriminating on gender, racial discrimination, inciting riots, disrupting security, disrupting public order; false information, humiliate others, slander; infringing upon the economic management order; manifestations of prostitution, social evils; human trafficking and instigating, enticing and inciting others to commit crimes...\\n\\nIn addition, the Law also prohibits the conduct of cyberwar, cyber attack, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cybercrime; causing incidents, attacks, intrusions, hijacking, falsifying, interrupting, stalling, crippling or destroying information systems important to national security.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Law on Cybersecurity also prohibits the production and use of tools, means and software or acts of obstructing or disrupting the operation of computer networks and telecommunications networks; Distributing computer programs that harm the operation of computer networks, telecommunications networks, and electronic means.\\n\\nThe act of illegally infiltrating another person's computer network, telecommunications network or electronic means is also prohibited in the same way as opposing or obstructing the operation of the network security guard; Illegally attacking or disabling the network security measures...\\n\\nIn the era of information technology explosion, the issue of cybersecurity is not only a concern of each individual country, but it has really become a global concern. Therefore, the Law on Cybersecurity was born to protect all interests of all organizations and individuals when participating in online community activities as well as to protect the health of the network environment.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity was born on the basis of the systematization, centralization and legalization of Vietnam's previous regulations on network security management. The law is a synthesis of many opinions of experts, legislators, individuals and organizations... has been revised, reviewed, considered and synthesized in many aspects, so it is considered to be very progressive.\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity Law is not intended to deter foreign investors. On the contrary, it is intended to make cyber activities healthier. The Law's establishment of strict regulations on cyberspace for businesses operating in the cyber sector is to help foreign businesses consider more carefully when engaging in cyber business activities in Vietnam.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity does not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals; The law is consistent with the Constitution and does not hinder the implementation of international treaties to which Vietnam is a contracting party.\\n\\nIn our country, every year there are thousands of cyber attacks targeting the information systems of the authorities as well as the country.\\n\\nThe activities of cyberspace also generate many complicated and difficult-to-control developments, the consequences are not small for society, the consequences even lead to death, more serious than harm to the environment. national security ... by the words and statements in cyberspace. Therefore, the work of protecting national security and ensuring social order and safety in cyberspace is an urgent requirement.\\n\\nAnd so, the formulation of the Law on Cybersecurity is absolutely right and necessary to prevent and be ready to prevent threats to network security and protect sovereignty, interests, national security and order. order, social safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals throughout the Vietnamese territory.\\n\\nHowever, in the past time, after the Law on Cybersecurity was widely consulted by the XIV National Assembly and right after the Law took effect, there have been many accusations of bad actors, powerful forces. The reactionary continuously distorts the Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe nature of these subjects is just an excuse when Vietnam promulgates the Law on Cybersecurity for the main purpose of inciting hostility, causing national division, slandering and distorting policies on economic development, construction building a rich and strong Vietnam with the investment cooperation environment that our Party and people have chosen and are aiming for.\\n\\nFrom a legal perspective, the information and articles of these bad objects ultimately lack scientific basis and are not valid. knowledgeable about the law. Even the way of speaking, using words of these subjects are just words that lack culture, are not suitable with the fine customs and traditions of our nation as well as the period of civilized behavior that humanity is aiming for; deliberately distorting, distorting the truth, opposing the regime, going against the people's legitimate interests with hostility and hostility to the renovation achievements that our country, our Party, and our people have achieved achieve…\\n\\nAffirming that the Law on Cybersecurity does not completely violate the right to freedom of speech, the right to express opinions and opinions of citizens, but on the contrary, creates conditions for the exercise of this right in accordance with the law. Any organization or individual has the right to express their views, but of course they must comply with the provisions of the law.\\n\\nThus, the effective Cybersecurity Law is an important legal basis to protect all businesses, organizations and individuals when participating in cyberspace activities.

Even on the RFA website, it is vaguely argued that: \"hiding information is the principle of the Government of Vietnam. .. \".\\n\\nIt should be affirmed immediately that the above tone is a baseless fabrication, blatantly distorting the guarantee of civil and political rights in general and the right to information in Vietnam in particular. That action revealed the intentions and political motives that were not pure for Vietnam.

In the face of the strong development of the internet and electronic networks, protecting national sovereignty in cyberspace is an important and inevitable task. The Law on Cybersecurity defines the rule of law of our State, while respecting and ensuring human rights, including the right to access information. For websites operating in Vietnam, the Law on Cybersecurity also has very clear and specific regulations.

However, like every country in the world, Vietnamese law restricts freedom of expression, right to information and access to information in some cases, in accordance with the International Convention on civil and political rights, in order to respect the lawful and legitimate rights, reputation and honor of others; to protect national security, social order and safety, public health and morality of society. The cases that some websites cite to say that Vietnam violates the right to freedom of information, in fact, they have violated Vietnamese law. Like every other country in the world, in Vietnam all acts of obstructing or threatening the right to information and the freedom to access information; abusing the right to freedom of speech and freedom of information to infringe upon the lawful and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals; causing damage to the reputation and honor of others; infringing upon national security, social order and safety, morality and public health... depending on the nature and extent, shall be handled according to the provisions of law.\\n\\nHowever, we also objectively acknowledge that the guarantee of people\\'s right to access to information still has some shortcomings and limitations that need to be overcome soon. It is noteworthy that the implementation of the Regulation on speaking and providing information to the press in some ministries, branches and localities is not good. There are also signs that officials assigned to speak, provide information to the press are afraid of responsibility, push for unauthorized people or cite many reasons to refuse to provide information. Some officials assigned to provide information lacked speaking skills, did not thoroughly understand the issues and cases, so they could not meet the requirements of the press and public opinion. The coordination between the spokesperson and the specialized function is not close, leading to the situation that the information provided is not timely and unclear. The investigation and handling of subjects who violate the people\\'s right to information, spread misinformation, fabricate, defame, affect the honor and reputation of collectives and individuals... decisive, timely; sanctions are not strong enough...\\n\\nDespite its limitations, Vietnam\\'s achievements in ensuring the people\\'s right to information are fundamental and undeniable. Those advances have been recognized and appreciated by international public opinion. The Party, State and people of Vietnam always strive to promote the achieved results and overcome shortcomings and limitations. On the other hand, Vietnam resolutely fights and rejects all false claims, distorts and distorts the truth about the guarantee of human rights in general and the right to information and access to information of the Vietnamese people in particular.'\n",
      " 'Firstly, it is an important legal basis to protect national security; handling violations of the law, such as: (*) Against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, including using cyberspace to organize, operate, collude, instigate, bribe , deceive, entice, train and train people against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, for example, inciting information to attract large gatherings, disrupt security and order, and oppose law enforcement. official duties, obstructing the activities of agencies and organizations, causing instability in security and order...

An information system important to national security specified in the Law on Cybersecurity is an information system that is subject to an incident, intrusion, hijacking, falsification, interruption, stagnation, paralysis, Attack or sabotage will seriously compromise network security. With the above criteria, an important national security information system is identified in the fields of special importance to the country such as military, security, diplomacy, cipher; in specific fields such as storing and processing information belonging to state secrets; serving the operation of important projects related to national security, important national security goals or important information systems in the fields of energy, finance, banking, telecommunications , transportation, resources and environment, chemicals, healthcare, culture, journalism. The Government will specify which information systems in the above fields are on the list of information systems important for national security.\\n\\nCybersecurity protection for information systems important to national security is assigned to the network security protection force, which is directly the Cybersecurity force under the Ministry of Public Security, the Space Operations Force. network of the Ministry of Defense. To ensure compliance with the domestic legal system, the Cybersecurity Law also assigns the Government to specify the coordination between the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Government Cipher Board, functional ministries and branches in the appraisal, assessment, examination, supervision, response and troubleshooting of information systems important to national security.\\n\\nThird, to prevent and combat cyber attacks. The Law on Cybersecurity is the first law document that stipulates the concept of \"cyber attack\". Accordingly, “Cyber \\u200b\\u200battack is an act of using cyberspace, information technology or electronic means to sabotage or disrupt the operation of telecommunications networks, the internet, computer networks, information systems, information processing and control systems, databases, electronic means”. At the same time, specify specific groups of behaviors related to cyber attacks in Articles 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21; specifying specific groups of solutions to prevent and combat cyber attacks, specifying the specific responsibilities of functional agencies and information system owners. So:\\n\\n- Information systems of agencies, organizations and individuals are protected against cyberattacks in accordance with the Law on Cybersecurity.\\n\\n- Information systems important to national security are protected commensurate with their importance to national security, social order and safety.\\n\\n- Lawful rights and interests of organizations and individuals are protected against acts of cyber attacks.\\n\\n- The Law on Cybersecurity also stipulates a mechanism for coordination in preventing and combating cyber attacks of functional ministries and branches, and defines the specific responsibilities of the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National Defense and the Government Cipher Committee in the prevention and control of cyber attacks. , against network attacks.'\n",

The incident caused a stir in public opinion, especially when the Vietnam Revolutionary Press Day June 21 was approaching.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that the cyber attack occurred right after the VOV electronic newspaper had just published two articles reflecting a phenomenon that emerged in recent times related to the use of social networks to make deviant and offensive statements. and offending individuals and organizations, affecting social order. In the articles, there are comments from experts in many fields such as culture, education, law, and journalism, thereby giving an objective and multi-dimensional view of a current issue. public attention. This is a common and necessary journalistic activity in the context of the growing social network, which leads to the emergence of the trend that users have more and more negative and complicated ways of expressing themselves. timely adjustment. However, the right work of a news agency has been met by cyber attacks. Some subjects also openly manipulated, provoked, and instructed the online community on how to \"take down\" VOV electronic newspaper for publishing articles that these people disagreed with. Not stopping there, a number of reporters and figures who participated in expressing opinions in two articles became targets of insults and attacks on social networks; Their families and loved ones are also affected.\\n \\nIt can be seen that the incident is very serious because the technical background of a national media agency has been blatantly attacked. Professional activities of journalists and professionals are hindered. This is considered an act of defiance, disregarding the law, violating the Law on Cybersecurity (2018), the Law on Access to Information (2016), the Penal Code (2015) and most directly. is the Press Law (2016), which requires strict handling. Currently, the authorities are actively involved in the search for the culprit.\\n \\nWhile the incident at VOV electronic newspaper has not yet subsided, on the afternoon of June 15, some newspapers continued to face intense cyber attacks. Specifically, Ho Chi Minh City Legal Newspaper (plo.vn) was also attacked by DDoS, causing network congestion and bandwidth overflow. For hours, readers could not access plo.vn.\\n \\nOn the same day, accessing the websites of the Liberation Saigon Newspaper and the Youth Newspaper was also very difficult and often interrupted. According to initial assessment, the method used by the subjects to attack the network on June 15 with the above newspapers is similar to the cyber attacks on VOV electronic newspaper.\\n \\nFrom the above incident, there are issues that need to be quickly reviewed and resolved by the relevant authorities. In the past time, it is no longer unique for some subjects to provoke and attack the networks of press agencies and journalists in various ways. The risk of hackers attacking newspapers or electronic websites can happen at any time. This fact requires the press agencies to proactively equip technical plans, systems and response plans, in order to minimize damage to the lowest level if a bad situation occurs. In addition, it is necessary to build a synchronous coordination mechanism among relevant agencies to support and protect the cybersecurity of press agencies, as well as to protect the safety of journalists. true. The handling of subjects who commit violations and obstruct press activities should be strict and deterrent. For individuals who participate in promoting and abetting cyberattacks, they need to be considered responsible based on the provisions of the law. Doing these things well will contribute to creating a safe and healthy environment that helps press agencies, directly reporters and journalists, to perform well their duties and functions.'\n",
      " \"Lieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan - Director of the Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity Department, Ministry of Public Security - said so in an interview with the press about issues of public concern related to the Law on Cybersecurity just passed by the National Assembly. .\\n\\nAccording to Lieutenant General Thuan, the draft law was developed in November 2016 according to the resolution of the National Assembly with the participation of many ministries and branches.\\n\\nDuring the construction process, the Drafting Board received, considered and adjusted in accordance with the recommendations of businesses and telecommunications groups, and also approached the responsible people of Google and Facebook, the American Business Association. States to explain and listen.\\n\\n* Many people fear that the Law on Cybersecurity will be passed, Facebook and Google will withdraw from Vietnam?\\n\\n- There is no information about Google and Facebook withdrawing from Vietnam. Certainly with a market share in Vietnam of more than 48 million accounts, it is one of the leading markets of Facebook and Google.\\n\\nAccording to my discussions with representatives of those corporations, I do not see that they have any other opinion. They only asked if the enactment of the law would have any effect. We explained and they thought this is a matter of relevance and will adjust the strategy, not as someone propagandize will have a huge influence.\\n\\n* Is there an opinion that the Law on Cybersecurity violates international treaties to which Vietnam has committed?\\n\\n- The law does not violate international treaties to which Vietnam is a signatory. We did a very detailed review. The National Defense and Security Committee also presented very fully. I have contacted and listened to diplomats as a member of the Editorial Board, they all confirm that there are exceptions and that every country is the same.\\n\\nIf it's forbidden in real life, it's also banned on the internet\\n\\n* In the regulation of user data management, public opinion has raised the question that this will affect the user's freedom of speech. How do you comment?\\n\\nThis law does not affect freedom of speech. There is no law that provides new regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations using cyberspace like this law.\\n\\nThe law does nothing to impede freedom of speech. If we present our views correctly without violating 29 articles of the Penal Law, we will not be banned. Because it is forbidden in real life, it is also forbidden in cyberspace. It is impossible to threaten to kill people, guide the sale of weapons or incite demonstrations to bring petrol bombs and burn them... in real life, they will be dealt with, but online they will be comfortable.\\n\\n* The Cybersecurity Law gives too much power to the authorities in determining what content is defaming leaders, denying revolutionary achievements... How to avoid judgmental and emotional evaluations , not objective?\\n\\n- In fact, we have to do it properly. When determining content that violates the law, if it is related to information and communication issues, the Ministry of Information and Communications will appraise it. Regarding culture, the Ministry of Culture will appraise. The specialized agency of the Ministry of Public Security and National Defense will base on those assessments to request information when investigating law violations.\\n\\nThus, it can be affirmed that power cannot be abused. The prohibitions in the law clearly state that individuals, organizations and agencies in charge of cybersecurity protection take advantage of the Cybersecurity Law to infringe upon national security, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals, social order and safety will certainly be handled in accordance with the law.\\n\\nLieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan answers questions about the Cybersecurity Law on June 15- Video: Dignity\\n\\nOnly provide personal information when there are signs of violation\\n\\n* Does the fact that businesses have to provide customer information to the police is an invasion of the privacy of individuals, confidentiality and security of correspondence, which are protected by the Constitution? Are businesses and personal accounts concerned about information disclosure?\\n\\n- Currently, businesses themselves are storing a lot of personal data. Our parameters are being managed by them and are exposed and leaked a lot of personal information. For example, when you just got out of the airport, there was a message sent to take a taxi, or if you were in a meeting, you received a message to buy real estate ...\\n\\nThis leak is due to the bad management of the business. Businesses do not need to worry because the security agency has never asked for such concern before, only questioning the provision of information when that individual shows signs of breaking the law.\\n\\n* Legal experts think that not only the police but only the courts can make this request, sir?\\n\\n- Courts only convict when guilty. When there are signs of law violation, the appraisal agency is the competent agency.\\n\\nIn the Criminal Procedure Law, it is very clear that when there are signs of law violation, the competent authorities are entitled to investigate. That sign of law violation, the cyber security authority of the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of National Defense must examine the documents to determine. Only then will telecommunications and internet businesses be requested to provide information.\\n\\nIt is unlikely that the authorities will monitor all accounts on social networks. We only recommend businessesDomestic and foreign files provide information when investigating violations of the law as specified in Article 26.\\n\\n* But the concept of signs of violation is very vague?\\n\\n- Completely unambiguous because there are prohibited areas and are referred to by 29 articles of the Criminal Law. When formulating the law, the National Defense and Security Committee has carefully reviewed it. If we detect signs of a crime, we must definitely handle it and request information to clarify and verify whether it is correct or not. Only then can we deal with the law.\\n\\nKeep listening and adjusting\\n\\n* In what cases is the content posted on social networks considered to slander the Party and State leaders, insult the leader? Is calling people to protest considered prohibited under the Cybersecurity Law?\\n\\n- It can be considered that this is a dangerous situation in terms of cybersecurity when there is a phenomenon of inciting protests and causing trouble in the coming days.\\n\\nWe have to solve this story so that the bad forces do not take advantage of our compatriots to beat our own people, destroy the people's own property to spend on shopping.\\n\\nAnd when insulting great people, we must have the assessment of the Ministry of Culture to see if the violation is true or not. Only when the Ministry of Culture answers correctly that there is an insult, it will be implemented.\\n\\nCountries are very strict about the network environment. We are too loose, too free. Our privacy is lost, usurped, skewered.\\n\\n* Recently, Mr. Nguyen Si Dung, former deputy head of the Office of the National Assembly, said that the Law on Cybersecurity to protect national security is an unfortunate confusion about the object of the law. How do you comment?\\n\\n- The Law on Cybersecurity has clearly stated its scope of regulation, according to which, cyber security is the assurance that activities in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, rights and interests. and legitimate interests of organizations and individuals.\"\n",
      " 'First, it can be affirmed that the Law on Cybersecurity has absolutely no effect on people\\'s right to freedom of speech. There is no law that provides regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals using new network information like this. Never before has children\\'s rights been so protected on online information. The Law on Cybersecurity emphasizes the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations on network information. People are comfortable using the network to do activities that do not violate the law. There is absolutely no provision to impede free speech.\\n\\nOnly individuals who give false, fabricated, or insulting information according to 29 articles of the Penal Code will be handled. It is impossible to threaten to kill people online and be free, but in reality, they will be punished. It is impossible to freely buy and sell weapons, explosives, detailed instructions on how to use them, but in real life, they will be dealt with, but not on the internet… Who offends the nation, sovereignty, religion, or who discriminates against gender on the internet? …will be dealt with.\\n\\n-Is it mandatory for businesses to disclose personal information to security agencies in violation of personal privacy protection?\\n\\nNo violation whatsoever. Because there is article 17 of the Law already. Article 17 is very strict to protect the privacy of individuals and families. \"Enterprises when providing telecommunications services, internet and value-added services... are responsible for verifying information when users register for digital accounts, and keeping user\\'s account information confidential.\" Therefore, it is the responsibility of the business to maintain confidentiality. Failure to do so will be handled.\\n\\n\"Provide information to users in charge of network security protection upon written request to serve the investigation of violations of the law on network security\". In the event that the Law provides so, it will be provided. For example, when I see an online exchange of buying and selling explosives to prepare for terrorism, the involved party must definitely provide information for us to handle, otherwise a disaster will occur.\\n\\nIn addition, information will not be arbitrarily provided and must be treated as confidential. If you reveal that secret, you will be held responsible. Right now a lot of our information is being leaked.\\n\\n-But the sign of violation seems to be very vague, sir?\\n\\nNot at all vague. This issue is referred to in 29 articles of the Criminal Law. If we detect signs of a bomb, we have to arrest it immediately. Information must be requested to verify if the person is true or just fabricated information. And after that, we can handle the law or handle it in another form.\\n\\nAnd I believe that when formulating this, the National Assembly\\'s Committee on Defense and Security and the Law Committee of the National Assembly scrutinized it very carefully.\\n\\n-In the Law, there is a sentence that is quite vague. For example \"insulting great people\". So how to identify \"great man\", sir?\\n\\nThis must be appraised by the relevant functional ministries. If the Ministry replies that there is a violation, we will be handled. For example, related to credit fraud, it is necessary to ask the State Bank and financial economic groups to determine whether there is a violation. There are a lot of people losing money and this has to be verified by a cybersecurity agency. We have to step by step investigate, verify and clarify whether it is subjective, objective, age...\\n\\nOf course, no law is perfect. Someone asked me, \"Does this law prevent acts in cyberspace?\". I replied: \"Criminal Law is enacted, but murder is still there, robbery is still there\". Having a Cybersecurity Law is there to provide scope for what is protected and to know prohibited behavior for us to avoid. Even the agency in charge of cybersecurity must rely on this Law to know what is prohibited and what is allowed.\\n\\n-From now until the decree is formulated, will the editorial board continue to listen to people\\'s opinions, sir?\\n\\nThe editorial board is always listening, always adjusting, always asking for what is appropriate to be submitted. All decrees are commented by agencies, economic groups, and internet telecommunications groups. I affirm so.\\n\\n-During the drafting of the Law on Cybersecurity, did we work with Google…?\\n\\nThe draft Law on Cybersecurity was developed in November 2016 according to the Resolution of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister then issued a decision to establish a Drafting Committee. Members include many ministries and branches, not only the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Defense, etc. During the construction process, the drafting committee also followed Decree 72 on setting up servers and offices in Vietnam. Then, when submitting the Law on Cybersecurity at the 4th Session of the National Assembly, the National Assembly also asked how to adjust it to suit the recommendations of businesses and internet telecommunications corporations.\\n\\nDuring the drafting process, the drafting team also had the opportunity to approach major telecommunications corporations in the world such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, American Business Association, ASEAN.... Thereby to explain and listen to their opinions on our Cybersecurity bill.\\n\\nAfter the two sides have worked and agreed, the representatives of those units have agreed toThey will adjust their strategy accordingly. The corporations themselves, these units also see our adjustments and regulations as appropriate. It is completely unlikely that Google and Facebook will withdraw from the Vietnamese market. And certainly with a market share like that of Vietnam, currently 48 million Facebook accounts and will certainly be larger, so there is no such thing as rumors. There is absolutely no information about this'\n",
      " 'According to Mr. Nguyen Huy Dung, today\\'s press agencies apply many different technologies and need to ensure information security. This work needs to go hand in hand with the digital transformation of the press agency. In addition, the media is also often seen as a target for hackers.\\n\\nMr. Dung said, the summary shows that when a cyber attack occurs, the press - media is one of the three targets of attack along with the network, electricity or a combined attack on all three groups. this object at the same time. For example, in the cyberattack on Ukraine in January 2017, the attackers took control of all three target groups: the press - the network operator - the electricity. The cyber attack at that time caused the press to report false information, the people who lost power were bewildered… but the target of the attack was for another purpose.\\n\\nThe Department of Information Security recommends that the press agency choose a network security partner. Vietnam has many good enterprises in the field of network safety and security. Press information systems are all level 3 and 4 information systems. Accordingly, the Department of Information Security recommends that press agencies urgently apply measures to ensure information security, comply with standards and regulations. national cybersecurity.\\n\\nOne point worth noting is that most of the attacks, the attackers often target the weakest point of the system, which is located in the end user, not the server, administrator... As noted by the Information Security Administration , many attacks stem from sending an email of work-related content. Out of curiosity, users can click (click) on that email. The content of the email, the attached word file is very normal, but when the user clicks it, it will activate the malicious code, infecting that user\\'s device.\\n\\nWhen a user\\'s content and files are infected with malicious code and sent to colleagues, other colleagues are also infected. From there, the system of ordinary users will escalate exclusively to infect systems, potentially exposing information to the outside, even taking control of the system.\\n\\nMr. Dung also mentioned that there is a remarkable statistic that more than 80% of the risk, the risk of being hacked is aimed at the end user and comes from the end user. Therefore, it is very important to disseminate, propagate and raise awareness of the end user community.\\n\\n“The Internet is inherently insecure, while the digital society and digital economy depend on the Internet. Therefore, the dissemination of information security to users will contribute to promoting digital payment, e-commerce, and society. The right propaganda to create a sense of security, a safe and healthy cyberspace, international businesses can rest assured to invest in Vietnam,\" Dung emphasized.\\n\\nAccording to a statistic of the Department of Information Security, 60% of news and articles on information security focus on risks and loss of information security. The Internet community has developed, so news and articles should focus on supporting users and guiding users on a safe network environment instead of the current 20%, promoting positive energy for users.\\n\\nInformation about technology also needs to be verified to ensure authenticity. Mr. Dung expected press agencies and journalists to accompany the Department of Information Security to enhance information security for press agencies\\' systems as well as ensure a safe network environment.'\n",
      " 'The Law on Cybersecurity has been consulted by National Assembly deputies since March 2017. Right at the meeting, before voting and approving, a number of articles with different opinions such as Articles 10 and 26 were also consulted at the National Assembly. During the session, the agencies that drafted the Law on Cybersecurity and the National Assembly listened to and absorbed many opinions from agencies, scientists and people, etc., revised the document, so the law was approved. The National Assembly approved it with a high rate (86.86% of the delegates approved). On June 28, 2018, the President\\'s Office held a press conference to announce the President\\'s Order on announcing the Cybersecurity Law and 6 other laws just passed by the National Assembly. The Law on Cybersecurity will take effect from January 1, 2019.\\n\\n\\nIllustration.\\nHowever, up to now, many Western news agencies, newspapers and many websites with servers in foreign countries still deliberately distort and obstruct the Law on Cybersecurity from coming to life. They said: “The Cybersecurity Law opens the way for a new crackdown!”; that \"cybersecurity law raises human rights concerns and affects national commerce\"...\\n\\nAfter the Law on Cybersecurity was passed by the National Assembly, led by overseas network information, some domestic dissidents incited people, leading to some disruptive protests in several places. During these disruptive protests, slogans were pre-printed and distributed in advance. It can be said that the hostile forces had a rather detailed and methodical plan to distort and hinder the Cybersecurity Law from coming to life.\\n\\nSo why does Vietnam need a Cybersecurity Law? Does the Law on Cybersecurity infringe on people\\'s rights and interests, hinder the State of Vietnam from implementing international commitments to which Vietnam has signed and acceded? What is the purpose of distorting and obstructing the Cybersecurity Law from entering the lives of opponents?\\n\\nFirst of all, why does Vietnam need a Cybersecurity Law?\\n\\nUnlike previous historical periods, defending the Fatherland is protecting the border, protecting the land, airspace and sea of \\u200b\\u200bthe country, today, defending the Fatherland must also protect the electronic space of the Fatherland. country. In fact, since the advent of the internet and social networks, there have been a number of uses of the internet and social networks to gather forces, incite protests, cause trouble, and call for the overthrow of the government. Today, hostile forces have added a new method to sabotage the state, which is to use the internet and social networks to attack agencies and organizations, and even cause riots and overthrows. social regime. For example, they use hackers (hackers) to cause economic, political and social instability. Remember in March 2017, there was a case of hackers attacking a series of domestic airport websites, causing many flights to be disrupted and turned upside down.\\n\\nThe Internet and social networks used to be a method of spreading false information for malicious and despicable purposes, such as: Fraud to appropriate property to mental terrorism - threatening to post personal information online, private life, causing many families to be broken, lives disturbed, even many people find death...\\n\\nHowever, what is more dangerous is that hostile forces use the internet and social networks to carry out plans to overthrow the regime and the State by inciting people to gather in large numbers and demonstrate \"non-violently\". political instability, causing unpredictable consequences. Therefore, the Vietnamese State needs to have strict sanctions against cybercriminals.\\n\\nSecond, does the Law on Cybersecurity infringe on people\\'s rights and interests, hinder the Vietnamese State from implementing international commitments to which Vietnam has signed and acceded?\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity consists of 7 chapters and 43 articles. The principles of network security protection are: (1) Complying with the Constitution and laws; ensure the interests of the State, the lawful rights and interests of organizations and individuals; (2) Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the unified management of the State; ... (3) Closely combine the task of protecting network security... ensuring human rights and citizens\\' rights, creating conditions for organizations and individuals to operate in cyberspace…” (Article 4).\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity only stipulates sanctions for using cyberspace to commit acts against the State, infringing upon the rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals. These are the following activities: (1) Organizing, operating, colluding, instigating, bribing, deceiving, enticing, training and training people against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; (2) Distorting history, denying revolutionary achievements, undermining the great national unity bloc...; (3) False information causes confusion among the people, causes damage to socio-economic activities, etc., infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of other organizations and individuals; (4) Prostitution, social evils, human trafficking; posting lewd, depraved, criminal information; destroy the nation\\'s fine customs and traditions…; (5) Instigating, enticing, inciting others to commit crimes... (6) Taking advantage of or abusing cybersecurity protection activities to infringe upon sovereignty, interests, national security, order, social safety, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals or for self-seeking purposes” (Article 8).Does the Law on Cybersecurity violate commitments with the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and large network enterprises such as Google and Facebook will leave Vietnam?\\n\\nAccording to the report of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, the WTO and CPTPP agreements have exceptions on security. Accordingly, Vietnam has the right to require domestic and foreign enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the internet and other services to store important data of service users in Vietnam - to set up a server in Vietnam. Virtualization in Vietnam is completely legal. It is known that so far there have been more than 18 WTO member countries (including the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, France) that require network businesses to store data in their territories. . According to the National Assembly Standing Committee, currently, Google and Facebook are storing data of Vietnamese agencies, organizations and individuals in data centers located in Hong Kong (China) and Singapore. If the Law on Cybersecurity comes into effect, it is feasible for these businesses to transfer and store data to Vietnam.\\n\\nWhat about large network enterprises like Google, Facebook already present in Vietnam? Vietnam is now a big market for them. Moreover, providing network services is now also a market that countries can choose from their point of view. For Vietnam, protecting and ensuring national security in cyberspace is always a top priority. This is something that Google and Facebook definitely have to consider. Recently, on 5-7, when the facebook social network named the two archipelagoes of Hoang Sa and Truong Sa in China\\'s waters, it received a strong response from Vietnamese netizens and the Ministry of Information and Communications. pine. In the end, this world\\'s largest social network had to correct the mistake and apologize to Vietnam.\\n\\nIn terms of rights and interests of individuals, organizations and enterprises, the Law on Cybersecurity is completely unrestricted on the rights and interests of the above group of subjects, because the sanctions of the Cybersecurity Law only apply to those acts. committing crimes (through taking advantage of the internet, social networks-Article 8). On the other hand, the Cybersecurity Law also protects people and businesses to always have a healthy, honest information environment, get rid of pollution such as air, drinking water and clean food for the spirit. .\\n\\nThird, what is the purpose of distorting and obstructing the Cybersecurity Law from entering the lives of bad guys?\\n\\nUnlike the Press Law, the Law on Access to Information, the Government\\'s Decree on the management, provision and use of internet services and network information, etc., the Law on Cybersecurity has specific provisions to eliminate information. bad news, malicious right at the root, from websites that hostile forces are using to destroy the social regime and the State of Vietnam. At the same time, the Law on Cybersecurity is the legal and scientific basis for handling those who take advantage of the internet and social networks to destroy the social regime and the State and harm individuals, organizations and businesses. industry of Vietnam. Based on this law, the authorities have the right to require the network operators to provide full information of the accounts that spread malicious information ... and this is a big worry of the bad guys.'\n",
      " 'After listening to the voters\\' opinions, the General Secretary spent a considerable part of his time talking more about issues related to the draft Law on Special Administrative-Economic Units (referred to as the Law on Special Administrative-Economic Units for short). zone) was pushed back and the new Cybersecurity Law was passed in its 5th session.\\n\\nThe General Secretary talked about the Law on Cybersecurity and the Law on Special Zones: There is incitement to patriotism - Photo 1.\\nGeneral Secretary met voters in Hanoi on the morning of June 17 - Photo: Nguyen Nam\\n\\nRegarding the two laws mentioned above, the General Secretary commented that recently the public opinion and the press in the country are \"boiling\" and there are protests, taking advantage of the people\\'s patriotism, inciting elements to cause trouble. .\\n\\n\"We focus on correcting, overcoming and strictly handling those who lead and oppose bad motives,\" the General Secretary emphasized.\\n\\nSeparately explaining the Law on Special Economic Zones, the General Secretary said that Vietnam has advocated building a special economic zone since the 1990s of the last century. At that time, Mr. Vo Van Kiet was Prime Minister and went to survey Van Phong (Khanh Hoa) area for testing. Recognizing that this is a way to attract investment and is also a \"difficult, new, sensitive and important\" issue, the General Secretary said the steps are very cautious. \"The Resolution of the Central Committee and the directives clearly state how to be effective because it is related to national defense, security and social safety, how to promote strength at home and abroad while ensuring Sovereignty. That is the consistency. As for the specific design, each country is different, each region is different, \"- the General Secretary affirmed.\\n\\nThe Party General Secretary also further analyzed: When there are suggestions, the Party, State and National Assembly need to listen, absorb, and pass them when they are perfected. \"Where have we approved, leaving to have more time to work. From the afternoon of June 8 it was decided to stop, why did they still protest until June 10 and 11, proving that they have intentions\"- General Secretary pointed out.\\n\\nTalking more about the content of 99-year land lease, which caused a stir in public opinion, the General Secretary affirmed that \"it does not have to be handed over to country A, which country B can rent it freely, but depending on the specific project\".\\n\\nAccording to the current law, the land lease term is regulated not to exceed 70 years. But, because this is a special zone, according to the original plan, to encourage investment, the regulation should not exceed 99 years. However, to be able to lease land with that term, it must go through many processes and be approved by the Prime Minister.\\n\\n\\n\"Using this point to say that China in 99 years is losing its country, inciting protests to express patriotism, leading to anti-corruption and sabotage. The deep essence is to distort the truth and provoke. the people\\'s genuine patriotism to plot other things, having the hands of saboteurs, not excluding foreign elements,\" the General Secretary pointed out and wanted voters to be very alert, calm, and confident. the leadership of the Party, State and Government.\\n\\nThe General Secretary added: \"It\\'s all for the country, for the people, not for any other purpose, no one foolishly or naively assigns land to a foreign country for people to come here.\"\\n\\nThe General Secretary also noted the vandalism of elements that existed before with the 2001 and 2004 incidents in the Central Highlands, and 2014 in Muong Nhe. Noting that taking advantage of protests to disrupt politics is very dangerous, the General Secretary also asked voters and people to soberly criticize and smash the destructive negativity.\\n\\nRegarding the raised issues related to the Law on Cybersecurity, the General Secretary also said that there was agitation.\\n\\nThe General Secretary said: \"In the world, many countries have this law. In the era of the 4.0 technology revolution, there are many benefits, but on the other hand, it is very difficult to manage. From here, there are incitements, demonstrations, and troubles. , to overthrow the government. Therefore, we need this law to protect this regime. We can\\'t say whatever we want to say. It\\'s very beneficial, but it\\'s very dangerous if we\\'re not vigilant. There must be laws to protect cybersecurity, national security and citizens\\' rights.\"\\n\\nThe General Secretary also very frankly shared that if there are internal defects, they should be corrected, not indulged or hidden, however, using them to provoke and oppose the regime will result in loss of the country and the regime.\\n\\n\"These two laws are very sensitive. The Law on Cybersecurity has been passed, the Law on Special Economic Zones will continue to be researched and perfected, if it is beneficial, it will be passed\"- the General Secretary concluded.'\n",
      " 'Along with the development of technology, internet connectivity and the increasing rate of users of smart mobile devices, the digital financial services market is growing at a rapid rate in Vietnam. The Covid-19 pandemic occurred with the requirement of social distancing, increasing the development opportunities of digital services in general, including digital banking services in particular. Some trends in the development of digital banking services can be mentioned that are popular in the Vietnamese market today, such as: automatic banking services have been researched and implemented by many banks, such as Home Banking, Internet Banking. , Mobile Banking, e-wallets... The development of information technology with applications of artificial intelligence, Chatbot... has helped organizations providing financial and payment services to promote transaction support activities. , customer consultation 24/7; at the same time, integrate to create a digital ecosystem that spreads payment connection with public services, finance, telecommunications, electricity, transportation, healthcare... so that, on network-connected devices, customers can can use more utilities than face-to-face transactions. Currently, there are more than 100 financial technology enterprises (Fintech) operating, mainly in the fields of payment and personal finance, P2P peer-to-peer lending (directly connecting borrowers with lenders). on the internet via online apps) has worked quite effectively, helping to shorten the loan approval time from a few weeks at traditional banks to just a few hours. Up to now, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has granted a license to provide intermediary payment services to 43 organizations that are not banks. In general, the whole country currently has over 80,000 QR code payment points, 78 internet payment service providers, 49 mobile payment service providers, 30 commercial banks and 6 payment intermediary service providers coordinate to deploy [1].\\n\\nProtecting financial consumers against the strong development of digital financial services in Vietnam today\\nThe development of digital financial services has brought convenient experience opportunities for consumers.\\nAccording to statistics of the State Bank, in the period 2015-2020, the total number of payments via internet channels increased by 262.5%, the payment value increased by 353%; Mobile payments increased 1,000% in volume but up 3,000% in value. In the first 8 months of 2021, the total number of transactions via the inter-bank electronic payment system increased by 3.32% in quantity and 41.37% in value over the same period in 2020; payment via internet channel increased by 54.13% in quantity and 30.70% in value respectively over the same period in 2020, via mobile phone channel increased by 74.98% and 93.69% respectively. QR code channel increased by 66.81% and 133.12% respectively. Thus, mobile payments have far surpassed internet payments.\\n\\nThe development of digital financial services has brought convenient experience opportunities for consumers, but also created many risks that they have to face, such as:\\n\\n(i) Risks of information security. Currently, information disclosure, theft, buying and selling of personal data are common in cyberspace. More and more subjects collect, analyze and process personal data for different purposes, but do not notify customers or allow illegal acts to occur.\\n\\n(ii) Risks from fraud, online fraud. Taking advantage of network security holes, hackers attack the bank\\'s data system through its partners; attack directly on the website to change the interface to extort money and get data; penetrate the system to execute money transfer orders in order to appropriate information and assets of the Bank and customers; setting up websites impersonating banks to defraud customers; create online loan applications that transform from black credit to perform illegal credit contracts. Attacks on networked devices of low-security digital finance consumers to seize assets.\\n\\n(iii) Technology risks (risks due to technical problems and network problems). This is also a risk mentioned a lot when applying digital banking financial services because the more modern technology is, the more difficulties it will pose, leading to risks and losses that people cannot control. The state of wave loss, network congestion due to transmission line overload has affected the quality of digital banking services, such as delay in liquidity, financial loss. Although these risks and losses have only been recorded on a small and odd scale and scope, they are partly causing some consumers to panic and fear when using the service.\\n\\n(iv) Risks on legal aspects. Some legal regulations are slow to adjust, not keeping up with the development of new technology, which has affected the application of high technology in digital banking. As a result, it may lead to legal risks in legal disputes of customers consuming digital financial services.\\n\\n(v) Risks in customer authentication. Identifying the identity when a customer opens an online account is very likely to be risky, because the bank does not have enough proof of customer verification like the transaction method at the counter. While, verifying the customer\\'s identity is a very good job important to reduce risk, reveal identity or conduct illegal transactions.\\n\\nDIGITAL FINANCIAL CONSUMERS PROTECTION POLICY\\nDigital financial consumption activities usually have the presence of 3 participants in the digital banking space, including: NH, customers and associated partners of the bank; in which, all 3 subjects can become \"gateways\" for cybercriminals to attack. But, in any respect, the subject of risk is also a consumer of digital finance. An example is that, while banks pay special attention to ensuring network security, the counterparty does not attach great importance to this issue; and in many cases there is insufficient capacity and infrastructure for information security. In fact, there has been a case of NH being attacked only from promotional emails that they have hired a 3rd party to perform. If to bypass NH\\'s security system, hackers must have a certain level, then the attack from NH service users is much simpler, with no new trick of hitting greed, lack of customer understanding. Many recent cases have shown that by enticing customers to log into the fake bank website and declare security information to receive gifts, receive money from abroad... Most recently, Techcombank discovered that fraudsters took advantage of the loan needs of people who lost their jobs and reduced incomes due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pretending to be bank employees offering loans through forms they invented themselves, such as liquidation. loan records. It can be seen that many customers are not aware that personal information is also an asset that needs to be protected. Because from the personal information, such as: identity card number, bank account number, phone number, or date of birth..., they are often easily left on social networks, through transactions Buying and selling online has become a guide for crooks to find scams.\\n\\nWhile cybercriminals have many tricks to attack subjects participating in digital financial consumption activities with risks belonging to customers, financial consumer protection policies revealed a series of limitations and inadequacies, specifically:\\n\\nFirst, there is also a \"gap\" in the legal framework that specifically regulates financial consumer protection. Currently, the legal bases that are applied to adjust to digital financial consumers are mainly: Law on Protection of Consumer Rights, passed by the National Assembly on November 17, 2010; a number of specialized laws and sub-law documents belong to laws, such as: Law on Credit Institutions; Law on Securities, Law on Insurance. In addition, all current regulations are only suitable for traditional transactions and services, without taking into account some new methods, especially the development of the digital economy and the Industrial Revolution. Industry 4.0. Along with that, at present, Vietnam does not have a specialized statutory agency responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector; The coordination between specialized agencies related to digital finance is also inadequate, leading to inadequate management and investment of necessary resources in the protection of digital financial consumers. . This indicates that financial consumers are not considered vulnerable; The issue of protecting digital financial consumers in the context of digital economy transformation is still incomplete in terms of legislation and implementation monitoring mechanism.\\n\\nSecond, the handling of complaints about the security of financial consumer information is not very effective. According to the results of a survey of 540 random number financial consumers in Hanoi about the need to provide legal advice to customers in personal information security incidents of the Young Research Group of the Student Banks, up to 97% of customers do not complain about things they are not satisfied with, because they are afraid of collisions or take time for administrative procedures to resolve complaints. Most of the time, the handling of disputes related to banking financial activities according to the provisions of financial contracts is handled in the final agency which is the court, the proceedings are lengthy and expensive [4]. . In addition, although Vietnamese law has quite strict sanctions against those who illegally collect and use personal information of consumers, the maximum penalty is up to 7 years in prison. , but almost only applied when there is great damage, in fact, very few cases in this area are handled.\\n\\nThird, investment costs for customer information security are not satisfactory. To ensure smooth, safe and accurate digital banking services, banks have been constantly investing in information safety and security. A survey by the Vietnam Cyber \\u200b\\u200bEmergency Response Center in 2020 shows that 100% of credit institutions invest in security and security solutions from basic to advanced, such as firewalls, systems. intrusion detection; multi-factor authentication anti-virus system; anti-spam system; data filtering system; digital signature technology KPI; biometric authentication... However, investment costs for village safety In general, information still accounts for a small proportion (less than 10%) of the total investment capital for developing digital banking products and services.\\n\\nSOME SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT FINANCIAL CONSUMERS IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IN VIETNAM TODAY\\nNo matter how much technology develops, it will allow digital banking financial services to develop there and with that, cybercriminals also take advantage of the advancement of technology to attack the digital banking system, so no stop increasing risks for digital financial consumers. In order to protect digital financial consumers in Vietnam in the context of the deepening and deepening impacts of integration and the 4.0 Revolution, according to the authors, it is necessary to effectively and synchronously implement the following solutions:\\n\\nFirst, establish a legal framework for financial consumer protection. The regulatory framework should be directed to all stakeholders (financial consumers, financial consumer protection organizations, agencies directly responsible for financial consumer protection, etc.) That is the basis for regulating the conduct of each party, helping to protect the interests of financial consumers. Accordingly, forming a legal framework to protect financial consumers is: building a legal corridor on data protection, protecting user data privacy in order to create a secure digital transaction environment, safety, protect consumers, promote public trust in performing digital transactions and using digital services. Along with that, it is necessary to complete the Decree on electronic identification and authentication in order to further facilitate electronic transactions and digital services, thereby enhancing support for digital economy activities. At the same time, speed up the research and development of the Law on Electronic Transactions to replace or amend and supplement the Law on Electronic Transactions 2005 to create a legal basis for ministries and branches to complete relevant legal provisions. related, help promote digitalization, digital application, create a favorable transaction environment for people and businesses through digital channels, electronic methods.\\n\\nSecond, establish a specialized agency to monitor the compliance of financial institutions in carrying out their responsibility to protect financial consumers. This body must have certain authority, operate objectively and independently; has sufficient power, resources and capacity in inspection, supervision and is responsible for proposing policies and legal frameworks on financial consumer protection. In parallel, a financial consumer association should be established to act as a representative to protect the interests of financial consumers when their interests are violated; At the same time, it is an information channel providing financial knowledge and warning of cyber security risks to financial consumers to raise awareness and proactively prevent.\\n\\nThird, improve the responsibility of banks and financial service providers in protecting financial consumers.

      " 'Right from its inception (first appeared in 1997, boomed in 2006 when Facebook was born), social networks have been likened to a \"public square\", where everyone can freely exchange, information sharing, expression of views and opinions. Because, social network is an online platform that can operate on all information technology devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones with print connection- silk. Social networks allow users to create, share stories, articles, personal ideas, post photos, video clips, and announce activities and events online or in the real world, .. . which appears to be uncensored.\\n\\nBut since its inception, social networks have almost been identified as \"virtual worlds\", so developments in cyberspace have changed from being \"harmless\", freely expressing opinions. Political opinion has been the source of many incalculable harms, even upsetting and upsetting an entire polity and nation. That is the reason why the state has to adjust management measures for suppliers and users (individuals, organizations). That leads to the fact that until now, all social networking platforms have their own rules about what content is not allowed to be posted.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe promulgation of the Code of Conduct on social networks is towards common standards, respecting the law, so that all users of social networks can improve their responsibilities and avoid legal violations _Source: toquoc.vn\\n\\n \\n\\nOf course, each country has its own regulation with its own law, on the basis of international law, in order to prevent content that is harmful, malicious, inciting hatred, infringing upon the interests of other countries. individuals and communities, threatening social security and national security. At the end of April 2021, the European Parliament passed a measure forcing social media platforms to quickly remove or block access to online content with the meaning of \"terrorism\". The 27 countries in the European Union (EU) recently discussed tough measures in managing social media channels and online statements in the bloc\\'s countries, with the aim of shaping the online environment. safe, open, innovative and trustworthy society.\\n\\nAs with the whole EU, each member country also has more specific and detailed social network management measures. As Germany has issued the NetzDG Code (Law on improving law enforcement in social networks), effective from October 1, 2017 and officially applied from August 1, 2018. The NetzDG Code contains provisions that force social media companies to quickly remove \"clearly illegal\" content, such as \"hate speech, defamation\" and \"fake news.\" if you do not want to face large fines. Or like France, it also sets out strict limits and sanctions for abuses of freedom of speech that affect the legitimate rights and interests of others, including the protection of human dignity, against slander, slander; against racial and religious discrimination; against inciting violence, causing hatred; against invasion of privacy; prohibiting the publication of a number of documents related to national security... Specific provisions are specified in the Law on Freedom of the Press, the Civil Code, and the Criminal Law. South Asian countries, such as India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, etc., also promulgate laws related to the use of \"hate speech\" and the words, acts of ethnic division, causing social conflict.\\n\\nIn that general context, Vietnam cannot stand aside, especially when we integrate more and more deeply with the world. Therefore, the promulgation of legal documents and \"soft\" regulations to manage and regulate social network participants is natural and necessary. In it, it is worth noting that the activities of social network users with a green tick attached, who have great influence, even lead the online community.\\n\\nGreen ticks and influence\\n\\nGreen ticks on social networks, especially Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, ... show the level of the owner of the social network account. There are different approaches to the content and interpretation, but they all have a common point that is easy to understand, the common thing is that the green tick is a sign that the account is real, has many followers, has coverage. wide and has great influence on the online community. That is, if a social networking site has a green tick, its owner is a celebrity, respected, admired, and attractive to the public. In short, it\\'s the social media influencers.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nGreen ticks on social networks show the level of social media account owners_Source: shutterstock.com\\n \\n\\n\\nIn English, influencers are called Influencers, to refer to people who have influence on the community, able to influence the thinking and behavior of a group of people, even a large community. In fact, the influencers on social networks are KOLs (abbreviation of the English words Key Opinion Leader). KOLs can be individuals or organizationsc are influential in their fields and professions, such as politicians, experts, entrepreneurs, writers, artists, sports stars... Their influence is the impact on the community by what is posted on the social networking site they own (can hire a team of experts to manage and operate). Although social media is almost a \\'virtual world\\', the effects of celebrities are very real. For example, when giving a status line, posting a photo or video clip, etc. on a personal page or Fanpage (1), the written information, images, sounds, and video clips will be affected. influence readers, viewers, listeners to make them receive, analyze, verify, believe and follow. For social network account holders with a green check, they are almost assumed to be reputable, so what they post is considered correct, accurate, and undisputed, so the public easily believes it. But that\\'s not always the case!\\n\\nIn fact, many artists, entrepreneurs, and people with a green check have exceeded the limit when using social networks and have been reminded, disciplined, and even dismissed. There are many examples of virtual networks causing real disasters, which are really valuable lessons for many people, especially those with influence in cyberspace. The content of information, language, images that are excessive, deviating from standards when \"unmasking\", denouncing, lashing out, degrading, disparaging others has to be stopped, or adjusted. To be fair, it is clear that the denunciation of limitations, errors and violations of the law by other individuals and organizations is encouraging and worthy of praise. However, the public - the crime must be clear. It is impossible that when the community has recognized, thanked, and applauded, one can be \"free\" in an unethical way, regardless of standards, ethics, and laws.\\n\\nNot only stopping in Vietnam, many times some Vietnamese citizens also have condemnable behavior on social networks towards individuals and international issues that negatively affect the image of the country and people. Vietnamese. Please give a recent example. After the Vietnam national football team lost to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the 2022 World Cup qualifier on June 16, 2021, many Vietnamese social media users were \"outraged\". Aggressively, fiercely \"attacked\" the Facebook account of the referee to catch the Iraqi match Ali Sabah (Ali Sabah Adday Al-Qaysi). Foreign media reported, world social network users ridiculed and condemned. Referee Ali Sabbath had to temporarily lock his Facebook account, and at the same time asked for help: “I am offended by the comments of Vietnamese fans. Even though I blew the penalty according to the law, they still cursed and insulted me, they even asked to kill me.\" Although these are just individuals, not famous for their green ticks, but their impulsive actions, a dua \"crowd syndrome\", objectionable, condemnable, have ugly the image of the national football team. Vietnamese people are being highly respected and respected; negatively affect the image of the people and country of Vietnam in the eyes of international friends.\\n\\nYou can\\'t go overboard and deviate from the standard and break the law\\n\\nIt is alarming that the above examples are only recent, attracting strong attention in the online community and society, not exclusively in cyberspace. The status of social network users, especially those with green credits, taking full advantage of the features, effects, and pervasiveness of social networks, with a large number of followers to post new information. Unverified information, using deviant and ugly words to smear and insult the honor and dignity of others is happening more and more, with a level of complexity, sophistication and sophisticated and thorough investment. both in terms of equipment and content posted or streamed. Overdoing it on the virtual network has very unfortunate consequences in real life. It is clearly a violation of the law, which needs to be handled promptly and seriously. Even, not only are the administrative violations handled (although the amount of fines is nothing compared to what they earn from malicious information intentionally posted and distributed) but also need measures. stronger hand, from both the state management agency, and the network operator, as well as the condemnation and boycott of the community.\\n\\nOn May 28, 2021, the Ministry of Information and Communications issued Official Letter No. 1800/BTTTT-PTTH&TTĐT “On strengthening the management and handling of infringing information on social networks”. The official letter clearly states the development of social networks in recent years, especially two foreign social networks, Facebook and Youtube, with \"both negative and positive impacts on social life\". , and at the same time affirmed the strengthening of management to limit the negative impacts of social networks, and promptly handle violations of users. The official dispatch clearly states: \"From 2017 to now, the Ministry has directed the local Department of Information and Communications to handle many cases of violations by YouTube and Facebook users of social networks, of which notably: Youtube Hoang Anh-Timmy in Ho Chi Minh City, Hung vlog channel, Hung troll in Bac Giang, Tho Nguyen channel in Binh Duong. At the same time,The ministry has also asked Google to close many other YouTube channels of domestic users with illegal content.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPolice of Bac Me district, Ha Giang province issued a decision to sanction administrative violations against those who misinformed about the COVID-19 epidemic in Bac Me district on social networks _Photo: VNA\\n\\nBut, as mentioned above, the handling of violations is still not enough to deter and warn. Many subjects because of lack of understanding, trend-following, and blind greed still continue to post illegal content, which mainly offends the honor and dignity of organizations and individuals. other personnel; use offensive language, violate fine customs and traditions; spreading fake news, false news; advertising, providing services illegally; ... causing irritation in public opinion, affecting social order and safety. Therefore, it is necessary to correct deviant and illegal actions, strengthen management, and strictly handle violators to avoid causing negative impacts on public opinion. In addition, there are \"soft\" regulations that are popular, propagate and guide people to use social networks in a healthy and useful way.\\n\\nOn June 17, 2021, the Ministry of Information and Communications issued Decision No. 874/QD-BTTTT “On the promulgation of the Code of Conduct on social networks” (effective from June 17), with detailed and clear rules. The scope and subjects of application of the Code include 3 groups of subjects: state agencies, cadres, civil servants, public employees and employees in state agencies using social networks; other organizations and individuals using social networks; social network service provider in Vietnam. The Ministry also issued four general codes of conduct including: 1- The Code of respecting and complying with Vietnamese laws, respecting the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals; 2- Healthy Rules (behavior and behavior on social networks in accordance with the moral values, culture and fine traditions of the Vietnamese nation); 3- Code of Information Safety and Confidentiality (compliance with regulations and guidelines on information safety and security protection; and 4- Responsibility Code (responsibility for acts and conduct on the social networks, and coordinate with functional agencies to handle acts and information content that violate the law).\\n\\nIt can be affirmed that the issuance of the Code of Conduct on social networks is very timely, necessary, has a positive meaning, towards common standards, respects the law, in order to create \"armor set\" \"so that all users of social networks can increase their responsibility and can avoid pitfalls, or violations of the law. The Code is not mandatory or has a sanctioning function, but it does encourage people to behave properly online, consciously change, adjust behavior and ethics when participating in the \"virtual world\". to contribute to building a safe and healthy network environment.\\n\\nIn fact, there have been many legal regulations to manage the network environment, especially the Law on Cybersecurity (issued on June 12, 2018, effective from January 1, 2019), but there are only measures sanctions strong enough to handle strictly, promptly, and enough deterrent to prevent violations, especially those who repeatedly repeat offenders. That helps each citizen when communicating and acting on the \"virtual network\" can clearly recognize their responsibilities, rights and limitations to properly and well comply with the provisions of the law. Of course, once reality \"goes ahead\", there are things that the law has not adjusted in time, the addition and completion of legal documents, \"soft\" regulations to strictly manage Strictly, creating good conditions for healthy and sustainable development is something that needs to be identified and implemented soon. Thus, the right to freedom of speech, freedom to express opinions, views and attitudes of each citizen as stipulated by the Constitution and laws of Vietnam does not go too far leading to blasphemy, blasphemy, and violations of law. breaking the law, causing negative impacts on social security, fine customs and traditions, and on the healthy development of the country. That way, those who use social networks, especially those with a green check, will not be dazzled, but do illegal things, implicitly offending health, honor, slander, humiliate other citizens, against progressive moral values \\u200b\\u200band social justice.'\n",
      " 'Freedom of speech is a basic human right, but it must always be limited within the framework of the law. Article 19 of the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states: “The exercise of the right to freedom of expression may be subject to certain limitations and these should be provided for by law, in order to : a) Respect the rights or reputation of others; b) Protect national security or public order, health or morals of society”. Thus, freedom of speech is not absolute freedom. Under certain circumstances, freedom of expression may conflict with other legitimate values \\u200b\\u200bor rights.\\n\\nEspecially, in the context of the explosion of the internet and social networks, information becomes more complex and difficult to control. Through electronic information sites and social networks, users can freely express opinions, views, post or spread any information through their personal accounts without incurring any liability. which limit. Expressing one\\'s freedom of speech has never been so easy and so contagious. But this itself also brings risks when this right is abused, especially when those who post information on cyberspace have wrong views, extreme attitudes, inadequate legal awareness...\\n\\nLooking at the law enforcement practices of many countries around the world, it can be seen that there is no such thing as absolute freedom of speech. Each country, depending on specific conditions and contexts, imposes certain limits on the exercise of free speech by its citizens. In the United States, the limits of freedom of expression are shown mainly in the case law of the courts, especially the US Supreme Court, which allows the government to prevent and punish speech of a pornographic nature. , obscene, defamatory, offensive and aggressive, without being considered unconstitutional.\\n\\nIn France, the law on freedom of speech sets forth strict limits and sanctions to punish abuses of the right to freedom of expression that affect the legitimate rights and interests of others, including the protection of human dignity, against slander and libel; against racial and religious discrimination; against inciting violence and hatred (Law on Freedom of the Press, 1881); against invasion of privacy (Civil Code); Prohibit the publication of certain documents related to national security (Criminal Law). Expressing personal views on the internet is also governed by the Press Freedom Law.\\n\\nThe European Union (EU) has issued a Code of Conduct on the internet with the commitment to action of the world\\'s four largest online businesses including Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Microsoft. These moves aim to \"ensure the people\\'s right to true freedom of expression and create the basis for building a truly democratic and civilized society\".\\n\\nMost recently, in the midst of a \"storm\" of fake news about the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of countries around the world have implemented many sanctions, from warnings, fines to jailing those who spread false rumors. true. In China, the act of spreading false information about the epidemic is punishable by fines, public surveillance or imprisonment from 3 to 7 years if causing serious consequences. In South Korea, President Moon Jae-in declared spreading fabricated information about the epidemic a \"serious offense\". Meanwhile, in Malaysia, the Government has arrested 6 people for posting false information about the Corona virus. Iranian police also arrested a person for posting a fake video, announcing a hospitalized COVID-19 patient on social networks. In the UK, a \"misinformation control unit\" has been set up to conduct the identification of COVID-19 fake news and liaise with media businesses to remove it.\\n\\nThe fight against abuse of freedom of expression in cyberspace in Vietnam today\\n\\nFreedom in general and freedom of speech in particular need to be understood as freedom within the framework of the law. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1953 European Convention on Human Rights, and the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights all affirm the right to freedom of expression, but also emphasize freedom of speech as freedom. within the limits of morality and law, mainly aimed at protecting the dignity and honor (private life) of others, protecting business secrets, preventing discrimination, discrimination, and inciting violence force, war, resisting criticism, criticizing the government, especially if they are calls for riots, threatening public order and national security. Therefore, each country can consider its actual situation to concretize the exercise of citizens\\' right to freedom of expression.\\n\\nObviously, in any political regime there can be no absolute freedom of speech, countries strictly handle acts of abusing freedom of speech; promoting freedom of speech must be for the common good, not the absolutization of individual freedom, not taking advantage of freedom of speech to write, speak, or distort with bad intentions, regardless of morality and law. France.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, the Party and State always respect and guarantee human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. of citizens. Freedom of speech is considered a constitutional right right in the first Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1946: “Vietnamese citizens have the following rights: freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of organization and assembly, freedom of belief, freedom of residence and movement in the country and abroad” (Article 10). The 2013 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam continues to affirm: “Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, access to information, assembly, association, and demonstration. The exercise of these rights is provided for by law” (Article 25). Besides, we also have the Press Law 2016, the Law on Access to Information 2016. Our country\\'s legal framework on basic freedom of expression is adequate, synchronous and compatible with international law on human rights. Like other countries in the world, Vietnam has regulations to limit and prevent acts of abusing freedom of speech, infringing upon national interests, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations. , citizen.\\n\\nAware of the importance, benefits and dangers of the internet and social networks, our Party and State have adopted appropriate guidelines and policies to develop the internet and social networks; at the same time protect network security and prevent and fight against taking advantage of the internet and social networks to distort, oppose the government, and infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. Among them are Directive No. 28-CT/TW, dated September 16, 2013, of the Secretariat of the XI term, on \"Strengthening the work of ensuring network information security\"; Decree No. 72/2013/ND-CP, dated July 15, 2013, of the Government, on “Management, provision and use of internet services and online information”; Directive No. 15/CT-TTg, dated June 17, 2014, of the Prime Minister, on \"Strengthening the work of ensuring network information security and safety in the new situation\". The document of the 12th Party Congress clearly states: \"Focusing on the management of various types of information on the internet to orient the people\\'s ideology and aesthetics, especially youth and teenagers\". In addition, during the implementation of Resolution No. 35-NQ/TW, dated January 22, 2018, of the Politburo, on \"Strengthening the protection of the Party\\'s ideological foundation, and fighting against false views. contrary, hostile in the new situation\", the Central Propaganda Department has strengthened the direction of the work of fighting and countering false information and claims, conspiracy, and activities taking advantage of the internet and social networks to fight back. destroy the Party and the State. The Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Public Security proactively detect, fight, prevent and strictly handle those who take advantage of the internet and social networks to violate the law. The Cyber \\u200b\\u200bCommand (Ministry of Defense) was established under Decision No. 1198/QD-TTg, dated August 15, 2017, by the Prime Minister, playing a pivotal role in ensuring security. , national cyber security, fight against high-tech crime and \"peaceful evolution\" in cyberspace. The Press Law 2016, the Law on Access to Information in 2016 and the Law on Cybersecurity in 2018, both clearly stipulate acts such as posting and spreading false information, distorting, defaming, denying the government; fabricating, causing confusion among the people; distort history; denying revolutionary achievements; offend the nation, national hero; Untrue information, slander, insult to the reputation of agencies and organizations, honor and dignity of individuals ... are handled by law.\\n\\nReactionary and hostile forces at home and abroad have been taking advantage of freedom of speech to distort and destroy our Party and State, smear and slander the government, incite and panic among the people. , threatening national security and social order and safety. For example, regarding the passage of the Law on Cybersecurity, many websites and reactionary elements have distorted and distorted information, claiming that this law \"especially infringes on private space\", violate freedom of speech, the press, the internet\". Some people do not have enough information, lack of understanding, so they easily believe and make opposing statements, hindering the implementation of the Law. The Dong Tam incident on January 9, 2020 caused shock and division in the community because of too many conflicting news streams on social networks. Enemy forces also take this opportunity to propagate against the regime...\\n\\nThe phenomenon of spreading fake and false information online also causes many consequences. For example, while the State is making efforts to prevent, control and repel the COVID-19 epidemic, there are people who take advantage of the epidemic situation to propagate false information, distort the Party\\'s policies and guidelines, State policies cause confusion in public opinion. They fabricated a false picture of the epidemic situation in Vietnam, spread fake news, made up stories about the number of infected people, the number of deaths, and announced that the rate of disease spread was many times higher than that of the Government. government announcements, creating fear in the community, disturbing social life, causing doubts and conflicts between the people, the Party and the State.

      " \"The Law on Cybersecurity is a systematization, centralization and legalization of the previous regulations on network security management in Vietnam. The law does not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. The Law is also consistent with the Constitution and does not hinder the implementation of international treaties to which Vietnam is a member.\\n\\nAccording to the international index, Vietnam ranked 100th in the world and ranked last in the ASEAN region in terms of cybersecurity. The low level of cybersecurity led to about 15,000 cyber attacks in Vietnam in 2017, causing about VND 12,300 billion in damage. In the first 5 months of 2018, the authorities recorded 4,035 incidents of cyber attacks in Vietnam. Insecurity vulnerabilities increase by more than 300% per year, putting Vietnam at many risks when entering the industrial revolution 4.0.\\n\\nBuilding the Law on Cybersecurity is right\\n\\nIn such a context, Vietnam's formulation of the Law on Cybersecurity is absolutely right and necessary to prevent and be ready to prevent threats to cybersecurity and protect its sovereignty, interests and security. national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang affirmed: Cybersecurity is a very important issue affecting national security. In recent years, cybersecurity has become a special concern of many countries and international and regional organizations. Attacks targeting the network environment develop rapidly in both form and scale, cross-border in nature, seriously affecting the economic and political stability of countries. Meanwhile, efforts to improve security in the network environment still face many difficulties, especially due to the lack of legal institutions and capacity to ensure network security. Therefore, the development of the Law on Cybersecurity is absolutely necessary in the current context.\\n\\nProtecting citizens' legitimate rights and interests\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity is a systematization, centralization and legalization of the previous regulations on network security management in Vietnam. The Law on Cybersecurity regulates relationships in cyberspace in order to protect national security, social order and safety, and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, in contact with voters after the 5th session, the XIV National Assembly, clearly confirmed this: Scope of regulation, this law has 3 main groups, the first is national security, The second is social order and safety and the legitimate interests of organizations and individuals, which means that if we lean too much on national security, ensuring social order and safety, we will violate individual freedoms. in accessing information or the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises when using information? All of these are calculated to ensure that they do not affect personal freedom. And this law prevents and fights against illegal acts in cyberspace, but if using normal cyberspace, no one will cause difficulties. That is, legitimate activities will be protected.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity protects the legitimate rights and interests of citizens - photo 1\\n\\nIllustration (VNA)\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity does not contain any provisions restricting citizens' right to freedom of speech and press freedom. The Law concretizes and lists in quite detail the prohibited acts due to the violation of the law when exercising the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press of citizens because these acts have been prescribed as acts of violation of the law. offenses in the Penal Code. Regarding this, Mr. Vo Van Thuong, Politburo member, Secretary of the Party Central Committee, Head of the Central Committee for Propaganda and Education, when meeting with voters in Dong Nai province, emphasized: It must be affirmed that the law on Cybersecurity is complete. there is absolutely no violation of citizens' right to freedom of speech, the right to express opinions and opinions. On the contrary, it also creates conditions for the exercise of this right in accordance with the provisions of law. Everyone has the right to express themselves, but we must follow the law, not that we speak freely and then do whatever we want. There are legal provisions to regulate human behavior in the relationship between citizens and citizens, between citizens and society, and between citizens and the State.\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution and not hindering the implementation of international treaties\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity Law is not intended to deter foreign investors. On the contrary, it is intended to make cyber activities healthier. The fact that the law establishes strict regulations on cyberspace for businesses operating in the cyber sector helps foreign businesses to consider more carefully when participating in cyber business activities in Vietnam. The formulation of this Law is also consistent with the Constitution and does not hinder the implementation of international treaties to which Vietnam is a contracting party.\"\n",

(6) Taking advantage of or abusing cybersecurity protection activities to infringe on sovereignty , interests, national security, social order and safety, legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals or for self-seeking purposes (Article 8).\\n\\nLooking back at the current legal system of Vietnam, it can be said that the Law on Cybersecurity is designed in sync with the 2013 Constitution and other legal documents, such as: Law on Press (2016); Law on Access to Information (2016) and Government Decree on management, provision and use of internet services and network information, etc. For human rights, the Law on Cybersecurity is completely consistent with the International Conventions on Human Rights in general, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) in particular.\\n\\nIn the world today, there are 18 member countries of the WTO (including: the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, ...) have mandatory regulations for online businesses. must store the data within its territory.

      " 'However, in recent times, hostile and reactionary forces have deliberately distorted and distorted the truth about the exercise of civil and political rights in general and the right to access information in particular in Vietnam.

Even on the RFA website, it is vaguely argued that: \"hiding information is the principle of the Government of Vietnam. .. \".\\n\\nIt should be affirmed immediately that the above tone is a baseless fabrication, blatantly distorting the guarantee of civil and political rights in general and the right to information in Vietnam in particular.

The fact that guarantees people\\'s right to information in Vietnam has completely refuted these false claims.\\n\\n\\nIllustration / Tuyen Giao.vn\\n \\nThe consistent policy of the Party and State of Vietnam is to encourage and create all favorable conditions for people to be informed; exploit and use the internet to access information to serve the goals of socio-economic development, support administrative reform, improve the quality of life and exercise basic freedoms of the people. people. In that spirit, Vietnam has achieved many achievements in ensuring the people\\'s right to information. These achievements are first reflected in the construction and improvement of the legal system. The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has revised and promulgated many new legal documents to better ensure the people\\'s right to information, including laws and decrees such as the Press Law 2016; Law on Access to Information 2016; Law on Cybersecurity 2018; Decree No. 72/2013/ND-CP on “Management, provision and use of internet services and online information”… All of these legal documents comply with the socialist rule of law principle. , in accordance with the 2013 Constitution, not only ensures the right to receive information, but also ensures to improve the effectiveness and efficiency in protecting State secrets, preventing the disclosure and leakage of information secrets.\\n\\nDecree No. 72/2013/ND-CP defines the policy of the Party and State of Vietnam as creating favorable conditions for economic development, creating the best conditions for people in difficult areas to use Internet services and information on the Internet in search and access to information. In the face of the strong development of the internet and electronic networks, protecting national sovereignty in cyberspace is an important and inevitable task. The Law on Cybersecurity defines the rule of law of our State, while respecting and ensuring human rights, including the right to access information. For websites operating in Vietnam, the Law on Cybersecurity also has very clear and specific regulations. Ensuring information security in cyberspace in accordance with the Law on Cybersecurity based on international practices does not impede people\\'s right to information and does not hinder the operation of network enterprises deploying services in Vietnam. Male. This is clearly demonstrated in the United Nations Human Rights Council\\'s National Report on the protection and promotion of human rights under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) cycle III of the United Nations Human Rights Council, published at a workshop held by the United Nations. December 3, 2018. Accordingly, Vietnam is one of the countries with the fastest internet growth in the world, with over 50 million internet users...\\n\\nThe Government of Vietnam has implemented a system to receive feedbacks and petitions from people and businesses through the Government Portal, and annually develops and publicly publishes the PAR Index of Public Administration Reforms. State administrative agencies and the People\\'s Satisfaction Index with the service of State administrative agencies. In the context of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, the Government of Vietnam has established a National Committee, speeding up the construction of \"e-Government\"; portals of State agencies, in order to provide online public services, for officials, agencies and organizations to have direct dialogue with the people; so that people through the internet can express their thoughts and aspirations and send their opinions to the Party and government in order to improve the efficiency of receiving and reflecting information and recommendations of the people. In fact, the number of people using the internet and social networks to express their opinions, organize discussion forums, criticize the Party and State\\'s guidelines and policies, and send comments and recommendations to the authorities. in Vietnam is increasing. Much information from MXH has been checked, verified and handled in a timely manner by relevant authorities and authorities at all levels.\\n\\nIn order to ensure the people\\'s right to receive information, our Party and State have adopted many policies, including the development of press and communication. In order to enhance the publicity and transparency of information, the Prime Minister has promulgated the Regulation on the mechanism for speaking and providing information to the press of ministries, ministerial-level agencies, Governmental agencies, People\\'s Committees. provinces and centrally-run cities according to the provisions of the law and current press activities... Being interested by the Party and StateOur country\\'s revolutionary press has had a rapid and comprehensive development, increasingly showing its role as a bridge between the Party, the State and the people, as a broad social forum for the promotion of democracy; is the defender of the people\\'s legitimate interests... Not only has the number of press agencies, radio and television programs, and newspaper technology increased rapidly, the quality of publications has increasingly changed. new in terms of content and form of expression. The team of journalists has developed and matured in many aspects. In particular, the orientation of press development following the model of a multimedia media agency has created great possibilities for the transmission of information by press agencies, contributing to better ensuring the right to information and communication. receive information from the people.\\n\\nThe rapid development of mass media and the internet shows that freedom of speech and information freedom in Vietnam has improved and developed strongly. However, like every country in the world, Vietnamese law restricts freedom of expression, right to information and access to information in some cases, in accordance with the International Convention on civil and political rights, in order to respect the lawful and legitimate rights, reputation and honor of others; to protect national security, social order and safety, public health and morality of society. The cases that some websites cite to say that Vietnam violates the right to freedom of information, in fact, they have violated Vietnamese law. Like every other country in the world, in Vietnam all acts of obstructing or threatening the right to information and the freedom to access information; abusing the right to freedom of speech and freedom of information to infringe upon the lawful and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals; causing damage to the reputation and honor of others; infringing upon national security, social order and safety, morality and public health... depending on the nature and extent, shall be handled according to the provisions of law.\\n\\nHowever, we also objectively acknowledge that the guarantee of people\\'s right to access to information still has some shortcomings and limitations that need to be overcome soon. It is noteworthy that the implementation of the Regulation on speaking and providing information to the press in some ministries, branches and localities is not good. There are also signs that officials assigned to speak, provide information to the press are afraid of responsibility, push for unauthorized people or cite many reasons to refuse to provide information. Some officials assigned to provide information lacked speaking skills, did not thoroughly understand the issues and cases, so they could not meet the requirements of the press and public opinion. The coordination between the spokesperson and the specialized function is not close, leading to the situation that the information provided is not timely and unclear. The investigation and handling of subjects who violate the people\\'s right to information, spread misinformation, fabricate, defame, affect the honor and reputation of collectives and individuals... decisive, timely; sanctions are not strong enough...\\n\\nDespite its limitations, Vietnam\\'s achievements in ensuring the people\\'s right to information are fundamental and undeniable. Those advances have been recognized and appreciated by international public opinion. The Party, State and people of Vietnam always strive to promote the achieved results and overcome shortcomings and limitations. On the other hand, Vietnam resolutely fights and rejects all false claims, distorts and distorts the truth about the guarantee of human rights in general and the right to information and access to information of the Vietnamese people in particular. .'\n",
      " 'The Vietnamese State has always consistently adhered to the policy of respecting and protecting basic human freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of access to information, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. internet in general and social media in particular. This was enshrined in the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 2013, concretized in many laws, decrees and many other legal documents and vividly expressed in practice.\\n\\nIn addition to online newspapers, news sites, through social networks (Facebook, YouTube, Lotus, Viber, Zalo, Twitter, Instagram...), Vietnamese people can freely share information, images, clips, express their personal views and opinions on all issues of social life. In the political system and administrative apparatus from the central to local levels in Vietnam, more and more agencies and organizations use social networks to work, handle administrative procedures, keep in touch with the people, grasp and promptly resolve the legitimate thoughts and aspirations of the masses...\\n\\nSocial freedom must be accompanied by social responsibility\\n\\nIt is necessary to strictly control this disinformation and distortion of the truth spread on social networks. Photo: Tuyen Giao.vn\\n\\nVietnam\\'s legal system on freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of access to information of citizens is basically complete, synchronous and compatible with international human rights law. In particular, the Law on Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity (ANM), after one year of taking effect, has gradually come into life, bringing about very clear and practical effects in social life. Before, during and after the law was enacted, many misinformation from hostile and reactionary forces believed that Vietnam\\'s promulgation of the ANM Law was a \"violation of human rights, strangling freedom and democracy, by speech ...\". In fact, after a year of implementation, it has proven that the ANM Law does not violate human rights at all, does not stifle freedom of expression, but on the contrary has created a solid legal foundation for prevention, fight, and prosecution. manage illegal activities in cyberspace, protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals... All individuals are still allowed to express their opinions in cyberspace, free speech is complete. There are no restrictions if you comply with the provisions of the law. Besides, the law has helped create a healthy and safe environment. Many information, articles, video clips that negatively affect social standards and ethics have been prevented and handled; personal privacy is protected; business operations on a secured network environment; Those who spread false information, especially about the Covid-19 epidemic, which caused confusion in public opinion and affected the prevention and control of the epidemic, have been handled.\\n\\nBe alert in receiving information\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is also necessary to see that some people\\'s awareness and views about the internet, social media and participation in social media are not correct and incomplete. Many users think that internet freedom and social media freedom are limitless, not clearly seeing the connection between their rights, obligations and responsibilities when participating in social networks. Due to the biased view of social media, there are still people who view social media with a biased attitude. Along with the strong development speed of the internet and social networks, Vietnam is also a country at risk of illegal acts from social networks.\\n\\nIn particular, the status of fake news, fraud, misrepresentation and fabrication through MXH is one of the painful issues that have emerged in recent times. What is the cause of this situation? Analysis shows that public opinion reacts very strongly to issues of traditional moral values \\u200b\\u200bor hot issues, highly topical issues in social life. Taking advantage of this psychological factor, many people have created fake news, fraudulent news, distorted news, and distorted facts with personal motives and purposes. For economic purposes, an online sales department intentionally creates fake news and spreads fake news to attract the attention of customers to its social media page.\\n\\nThe outbreak of fake news and misinformation is also partly due to the people who access information, the people who participate in social networks. Due to limited awareness, lack of necessary knowledge and experience, many people do not know if the information they have access is right or wrong, has a scientific basis or not, affects others and society. How should I post, share, comment arbitrarily, irresponsibly... Taking advantage of this, hostile and reactionary forces create a lot of fake and malicious information to distorting propaganda, inciting, disturbing information, causing confusion in public opinion, creating instability in security and order to oppose our Party and State. Some subjects with the name of \"exercising the right to freedom of expression\" through social media to \"express their personal views\" were actually propagandizing against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and were handled before the law. After each case is handled, hostile and reactionary forces say that \"Vietnam violates freedom of speech\", \"violations of internet freedom\"... It should be clearly stated that that tone for no other purpose than to cover, tolerate and abet acts that violate the law and are deeply anti-Vietnamese. Respect and protect rightsSocial media freedom is the duty of every country in the world. But like other fundamental rights, the right to freedom of social media is only protected when it is used for the right purposes and serves the common interests of the community. Any act of abusing this right to violate the law, not only in Vietnam but also in most countries around the world, must be strictly handled.\\n\\nTo deal with fake news and bad news in cyberspace, first of all, it is necessary to propagate and educate people to clearly see the dangers of the problem; raising awareness and sense of responsibility of the people, especially social media participants, need to be alert in accessing information to avoid being taken advantage of to help bad guys, and at the same time actively fight the problem of fake news.\\n\\nFake news spreads fastest among readers who are ignorant but too gullible and gullible… Therefore, each person needs to uphold their own responsibility, raise responsibility for the content posted and share. shall. Social media can be compared to a market, where people sell all kinds of information and images without anyone verifying or censoring. There are both real and fake goods, imitation goods; both fresh and stale goods… Each of us should become \"wise consumers\" when participating in this information market. Keep yourself cautious and always have the attitude of a knowledgeable, sober person. Only then can we create a standard filter in this information \"storm\" era.\\n\\nSanctions severely punished\\n\\nLike most countries in the world, Vietnam always respects and protects basic human freedoms, including internet and social media freedom. On the other hand, for those who violate the provisions of the law on cyberspace, post information that is false, fraudulent, distorting, infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals. .. the competent authorities of Vietnam will strictly handle according to the law. Vietnam resolutely opposes and fights against all acts of abusing human rights in general and freedom of the internet and social media in particular to oppose and interfere in Vietnam\\'s internal affairs.\\n\\n On February 3, 2020, the Government of Vietnam issued Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP on \"sanctions for administrative violations in the fields of post, telecommunications, radio frequencies, and information technology. information and electronic transactions” replacing Decree No. 174/2013/ND-CP dated November 13, 2013.\\n\\nDecree No. 174/2013/ND-CP of the Government has quite specific regulations on the act of giving false information in the telecommunications environment. But the implementation process has limitations and the situation has changed, there are loopholes, the level of punishment is not enough deterrent... Therefore, the situation of using social networks, information pages, Personal accounts for posting false information have not decreased, even tended to increase.\\n\\nDecree No. 15/2020/ND-CP was born with 124 articles, more clearly and in more detail on administrative violations, sanctioning forms, sanctioning levels, remedial measures, competence the right to make minutes and the power to sanction administrative violations in the fields. This is considered a stronger remedy in preventing and combating fake, false and malicious information that has been spreading on the cyberspace recently.\\n\\nThe legal system of Vietnam is more and more complete, synchronous and timely to adjust all aspects of life. Bringing the law to life, raising awareness and awareness of law observance for the people is being focused on implementation by all levels, branches and localities. Along with that, in exercising their rights and obligations, it is important for each citizen to be very calm and alert in receiving and processing information. While exercising their rights, each person must also respect the rights and interests of collectives and individuals; always put the interests of the nation-nation first, clearly showing the spirit of rule of law.\\n\\nVietnam\\'s promulgation of the ANM Law, Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP and related legal documents is essentially to protect the right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of access. people\\'s information, internet freedom and social media freedom are getting better and better; making Vietnam\\'s network environment more and more fresh and safe, serving well the cause of national construction and defense. The argument is that the ANM Law, Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP and other legal documents that Vietnam has issued and implemented are \"strangling freedom of democracy, freedom of speech...\" , \"violating freedom of social networks\"... is actually an act of distorting propaganda against our Party and State. Vietnam always aims to build a state of law, progressive, democratic and civilized, in which human rights in general, internet freedom, and social media freedom in particular are respected and guaranteed. At the same time, Vietnam resolutely exposes and fights uncompromisingly with organizations and individuals who take advantage of this issue to violate the law and go against the interests of the country and the people.'\n",
      " 'Commenting on the Draft Law on Cybersecurity (Draft Law), Chairman of the Vietnam Internet Association (VIA) - Mr. Vu Hoang Lien - said: \"It is necessary to set goals to create conditions for development. The concept of development must be understood as not to be left behind, because that means losing both domestic and foreign markets because the conditions are too tight, which will push domestic enterprises into a difficult position.\\n\\nInformation from Mr. Vu The Binh - Vice President of VIA - said that in addition to vague terms and criteria, some issues need to be clarified, specifically: \"Regulations on network security applies to all enterprises, or only to enterprises/agencies in charge of important national security information systems; Potentially overlapping with provisions in the Law on Cyberinformation Security, the Law on Telecommunications, the Law on Information Technology…”.\\n\\nThe VIA\\'s document points out that there are a number of overlapping issues between the Draft Law and other existing laws, such as \"Section 2, Chapter II, the Law on Cyberinformation Security stipulates on standardization and conformity assessment. regulations on network information security. This assessment of conformity with standards and regulations is not only carried out by the Ministry of Information and Communications, but also functional units under the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of National Defense can also fully perform, in compliance with the Law on Standards and Regulations. technical standards. Therefore, adding additional requirements for assessment of conformity with standards and regulations on network security in Articles 15 and 16 of the Draft Law will lead to a situation where a product or equipment must comply with standards and regulations many times. .\\n\\nOr some provisions of the Draft Law appear to be infringing on the regulation of other current laws such as \"The refusal to provide services to users specified in Clause 2d, Article 47 is contrary to the provisions of Article 47 of this Law. Article 26, Law on Telecommunications - “Telecommunications enterprises may not refuse to enter into contracts or unilaterally terminate contracts with telecommunications service users, unless there is a written request from a state agency. competent in accordance with the law”.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Member of the Executive Committee of the Vietnam Information Security Association (VNISA) - Ms. Tran Thi Kim Phuong - said that \"some concepts and some regulations are not clear between the two concepts of network security and security.\" network security. For example, there are provisions on information systems important for national security, there are parts that need a clearer separation from national important information systems as stipulated in the Law on Security. network information. Some regulations on procedures and conditions in the same field will push businesses to be regulated by two state agencies, \"- Ms. Phuong said.\\n\\nMs. Phuong gave a specific example: “The operation of providing network information security services is currently under the regulation of the Law on Cyberinformation Security, which appraises and licenses the operation. However, in Clause 3, Article 11 of the Draft Law, the Ministry of Public Security stipulates that the Ministry of Public Security shall assess the capacity and conditions for enterprises providing network information security services and for information systems important for national security. Thus, these enterprises will be subject to the regulation of two different state management agencies. This causes difficulties for businesses and overlaps between the Draft Law and the Law on Cyberinformation Security \"- Ms. Phuong assessed.\\n\\nConfused about regulations on setting up servers in Vietnam\\n\\nIn the Draft Law, highlighting an issue that many opinions are concerned about is the provision in Clause 4, Article 34 on ensuring network information security, providing for representative offices and information data storage. users in Vietnam. VIA\\'s opinion is that \"This regulation is not feasible and causes difficulties for businesses, preventing users from accessing the best technology and most advanced products, and at the same time does not increase the level of network safety; May violate WTO commitments and commitments in TPP and prevent data freedom and inhibit the development of digital economy in Vietnam; There is a risk of increasing the cost of doing business in Vietnam for both domestic and foreign firms. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be more affected as they have fewer resources to ensure compliance with data storage requirements, as well as strict requirements for auditing and other compliance requirements”.\\n\\nIn this regard, at a press conference, a representative of the Information Security Department (Ministry of Information and Communications) said: \"Installing a server in Vietnam is an area that is almost within the sovereignty of national security, not the territory of Vietnam. within the scope of network information security. In fact, some foreign businesses have also set up servers in Vietnam. Some European countries and some other countries have also requested the same,” he said.\\n\\nConcerned about this, Mr. Vu Hoang Lien commented: \"If domestic enterprises want to enter foreign markets, what if people also create such barriers? Are domestic products guaranteed to be supplied as foreign products are providing? Because otherwise, users will find other ways to overcome barriers to use their other products. And if the domestic product is good enough, but there are limits anyway, such as globalisation'\n",

Will this lead to the risk of some big companies like Facebook and Google withdrawing from the Vietnamese market?\\n\\nVery simple and very easy when they are located in Vietnam, the bandwidth is much faster and much more economical.

Certainly with a very large market share like today, Vietnam with 48 million Facebook accounts, that is a huge market share that Facebook will have to consider.\\n\\nSEE CLIP:\\n\\nCybersecurity Law Play\\nIt\\'s so virtual\\n\\nThe fact that the Cybersecurity Law stipulates a series of prohibitions as well as regulations on the management of user data makes many people concerned that it will affect users\\' freedom of speech in cyberspace?\\n\\nWe still say \"it\\'s so virtual\", in fact, the Criminal Code stipulates 29 prohibited content, so by reference, these acts online will also be banned. And never before has children\\'s rights been so protected in cyberspace.\\n\\nThose whose dignity is violated, those who fabricate information whose behavior is referred to in accordance with 29 articles of the Penal Code and even the Civil Code, they must be handled. That means the rights of organizations and individuals are very protected.\\n\\nIt\\'s impossible for real life murder threats to be dealt with, and online murder threats to be freed. Weapons cannot be bought and sold, instructions on how to use explosives are handled in real life, but online is free. And it is impossible to incite protests, bring petrol bombs and sticks in real life, they will be handled according to the provisions of the law, but online, they will not be considered and handled.\\n\\nI affirm that this law does not affect the right to freedom of speech if we express our views correctly and do not violate the provisions of the law. We can still freely use the network to operate if we do not violate the law. We are allowed to speak, to criticize issues, as long as we do not violate the criminal law referred to.\\n\\nIt can be said that there is no law that provides provisions to protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals using cyberspace like this law. Especially religions and ethnic groups are protected. Anyone who offends the nation, who discriminates against gender will be handled according to the provisions of the law, of course, depending on the extent and specific instructions will be given.\\n\\nIn fact, revealing and leaking personal information is quite common nowadays, so how does the law control this? Does the law require businesses to provide data to investigative agencies in violation of user privacy?\\n\\nIt is businesses that are storing a lot of personal information and are revealing a lot of personal information. We just got to the airport when there was a message whether to take a taxi or not, weWe are meeting and also receive information about buying and selling land here and there. This leak is due to the bad management of enterprises.\\n\\nUntil now, the security agency has never asked too much, only when there is a violation of the law, we will raise the problem. That is a fact.\\n\\nArticle 17 of the law provides very detailed regulations on protection of secrets and prevention of leaks. The task of the agency in charge of network security is to protect those secrets. We can rest assured that if the cybersecurity agency does not do this well, it must be responsible for the country and the people.\\n\\nArticle 26 also stipulates very carefully, including the responsibility of enterprises to keep user information confidential. If that secret is revealed, the enterprise must be responsible.\\n\\nEnterprises only provide user information to the specialized network security force when there is a written request to serve the investigation and handling of violations of the law on network security.\\n\\nWe have to solve this story and don\\'t let the bad forces take advantage of our compatriots, hit our own people, don\\'t let our compatriots destroy our property, which is the taxpayer\\'s money spent on shopping.\\n\\nThere can be no abuse of power\\n\\nThere are concerns that this law gives too much power to the authorities in assessing content related to defaming leaders or denying revolutionary achievements. So how to avoid unbiased or perhaps attributed to organizations and people when they post such information on social networks?\\n\\nWe are doing it very properly and methodically according to the provisions of the law.\\n\\nIn determining information that violates the law, if it is related to information and communication issues, the Ministry of Information and Communications will be the appraiser, when related to culture, the Ministry of Culture will appraise. The specialized cyber security agency of the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of National Defense also, based on those assessments, proposes to provide information when investigating violations of the law.\\n\\nThus, it is impossible for the specialized force in charge of cybersecurity to abuse power.\\n\\nMoreover, the law also clearly stipulates prohibitions for agencies in charge of network security, or for certain individuals and organizations to take advantage of cyber security operations to infringe upon national security, legitimate rights and interests. Laws of organizations and individuals, social order and safety will certainly be strictly handled before the law.\\n\\nIn fact, it can also be seen that the Cyber \\u200b\\u200bSecurity Department or the Cyber \\u200b\\u200bCommand of the Ministry of Defense has never had such behavior.\\n\\nOn social networks, there are many opinions disagreeing with this law, there are even many opinions calling for protests… How does the drafting board deal with this flow of opinions?\\n\\nIn the immediate future, you must make everyone understand correctly, do not think about handling.\\n\\nThere is no perfect law. Yesterday, someone asked me if this law was introduced to prevent acts in cyberspace?\\n\\nThe agency in charge of network security must also know what is allowed, what is prohibited, if you violate it, you will also be strictly handled before the law.\\n\\nWe always listen to adjust, ask for the most appropriate content in the decree guiding the implementation of the law in the near future.'\n",

Regarding freedom of speech, freedom of the press, since 1946, in article 10 of the first Constitution, these rights have been affirmed.

Trained by an outside reactionary organization, Trang became increasingly a subject of extremist ideology. openly and decisively anti-corruption activities. In her 2018 self-declaration, Trang even confirmed her activities aimed at overthrowing the regime. Because of illegal acts, Trang has been prosecuted and detained by the security agency for investigation since October 2020.\\n\\nAn object that has no journalistic status and seriously violates Vietnamese laws, but is painted by organizations like \"Reporters Without Borders\" as independent journalists, fighting with the negative so that Vietnam has no freedom of the press.

Along with the development of the country, of the revolutionary press and information and communication platforms, these rights are increasingly regulated and specifically regulated according to the framework of the law.\\n\\nNewspapers contribute to the development of the country\\n\\nIn the so-called reports on the human rights situation in Vietnam over the years, a phrase often appears. That is \"Vietnam continues to violate freedom of speech and freedom of the press\". This tone, if compared with the reality of the development of the press in Vietnam today, no one understands, what is it based on.\\n\\nBy the end of 2020, the whole country has nearly 800 press agencies, more than 100 newspapers have electronic journalism activities; more than 600 journals; 25 independent electronic press agencies. Genres are also enough, paper newspapers, audio newspapers, video newspapers, and even electronic newspapers. If there is any kind of press in the world, there is that kind of press in Vietnam. Even the model of a converged newsroom with a full range of press forms at each press agency is also being promoted.\\n\\nUnfounded claims that Vietnam does not have internet freedom, misrepresenting press freedom - Photo 4.\\nArticle 10 of the first Constitution provides for freedom of speech and publication\\n\\nClearly, this growth cannot come about under an institution that, as disinformation claims, is the growth of a strangled press.\\n\\nVietnam\\'s current Press Law also clearly states what the press must not do, for example, the press must not incite people to oppose the State, undermine the great national unity bloc; must not incite violence, propagate wars of aggression, incite lewdness, debauchery, crimes; provide false information, distort, slander, in order to offend the honor of the organization, the honor and dignity of citizens. And looking at that, it can be seen that this prohibition is completely reasonable, and I don\\'t know which country allows this.\\n\\nExcept for such provisions, there is nothing in the law that requires the press to write this way or that way. Obeying the statutory principles not only promotes the development of the press, but also makes the press a resource that contributes to the development of the country.\\n\\nMore than a month ago, when implementing social distancing according to Directive 16, Hanoi city had regulations on issuing travel permits to people and businesses.\\n\\nIn the spirit of commenting because it is clear that the government has difficulties in implementing unprecedented solutions to combat the epidemic, many articles and reportages have timely reflected the multi-dimensional opinions of all classes. people, businesses andexpert.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany articles reflect different opinions on the regulations on issuance of road permits in Hanoi\\n\\nIn fact, over the past time, there have been a series of cases where the media\\'s multi-dimensional and constructive comments and criticisms have made an important contribution and brought about social effectiveness. In the spirit of listening, many authorities have made timely adjustments in line with reality. This shows that in Vietnam, positive feedback from the press is always appreciated and listened to.\\n\\nHowever, for a long time, in cyberspace, reactionary and unfriendly forces, organizations and individuals have kept repeating statements such as: Criticism is foreign to the Vietnamese press, the Vietnamese press. Men are only highlighted in pink, Vietnamese newspapers are censored and content-oriented…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Social criticism\" is the term stated in the Document of the 11th Congress, 2011 of the Party: \"Focusing on raising ideological character, strongly promoting the functions of information, education, organization and reflection. social advocacy of the mass media for the benefit of the people and the country...\". The Press Law 2016 also affirms: The press has the right to \"take part in the formulation and implementation of the Party\\'s guidelines, guidelines and policies, and the State\\'s laws\".\\n\\nIn fact, the Vietnamese press has contributed a strong voice in reflecting the reality of the country\\'s development with critical, multi-dimensional perspectives, reflecting both limitations, shortcomings, and not highlighting in order to contribute a constructive voice.\\n\\nTo say that the Vietnamese press only writes according to orientation is baseless… No one forbids criticism and is never forced to write this and that.\\n\\nMr. Tran Ba \\u200b\\u200bDung, Head of Professional Affairs, Vietnam Journalists Association\\n\\nReading from the internet, social networks, there is a very commonly used argument, that is, the Vietnamese press is strictly censored, only talking about positive information, beneficial to the Party and State, then which newspaper writes Regarding the negative, any journalist who dares to fight against it will sooner or later have to pay the price.\\n\\nReality is not so. The Party and State have been and always look at the truth, appreciate the truth, and also expect the press to reflect honestly, objectively and constructively; does not highlight but also does not blacken reality.\\n\\nThere are countless examples of negative and corrupt media reports. Daily life cases such as inadequacies in road permits in Hanoi during the epidemic season, and the non-food bread case in Khanh Hoa province, after the press got involved, the local government made adjustments and repairs. timely. Or without the participation of the press, the bluff spending of state money at PMU 18, to the laxity in cadre work in the Trinh Xuan Thanh case, how could it be detected and remedied.\\n\\nPainting an all-pink picture to cover up objective reality, this only leads to the collapse of a country, a regime. Facing reality, solving the evil seeds in the development process, that is the way for a country to rise.\\n\\nThe Party and State of Vietnam are doing that, and creating conditions for the press to participate in the process of reflecting on limitations and negatives has always been supported and facilitated by the Party and State.\\n\\nThe Party, State and people all highly appreciate the great contribution of the press on the anti-negative front. How many big cases the press discovered, committed, rushed into difficult places, to the end of the alley to fight negative corruption.\\n\\nMr. Lai Xuan Mon, Standing Deputy Head of the Central Propaganda Department\\n\\n\\n\\nRidiculous argument \"Vietnam does not have Internet freedom\"\\n\\nAfter distorting about press freedom, the subjects also said that there is no internet freedom in Vietnam. Most recently, a report by Freedom House organization listed Vietnam in the group of \"countries without Internet freedom in 2021\".\\n\\nMany Vietnamese people laughed because without internet freedom, how could one read such a one-sided, outdated and baseless report.\\n\\nAccording to the latest statistics of We Are Social, Vietnam is the country with the 12th highest number of Internet users worldwide. What about mobile Internet? From 3G, then 4G, and now 5G is being deployed, the Internet has reached every corner of the country, from urban to rural, from plain to mountainous, border, island, to every citizen.

As We Are Social & Hootsuite has reported on the Internet accessibility index, Vietnam has 150 million mobile connections and 68 million internet users. 3G/4G infrastructure has covered 99.8% of the population and fiber optic internet has reached 98% of the wards and communes.\\n\\nAs for Internet freedom, all the major social networking service providers in the world are present.\\n\\nIn Vietnam, the Internet does not merely serve the social life of the people. The Internet is a fundamental element to build a digital government and solve most of the government\\'s work.\\n\\nBut in many different ways, hostile forces try to distort Vietnam\\'s freedom to access the Internet. They argue that Vietnam has not made any progress in this regard.\\n\\nRecently, hostile forces also said that in Vietnam, social network users are not allowed to express their thoughts and opinions. But the fact is that people arrested by Vietnamese authorities are cases of violations of Vietnamese law with very specific violations.\\n\\nFreedom House is an organization in the US, with a very weak reputation in Europe, they like to evaluate and \"teach life\" other countries on how to behave… From the beginning, the report intended to criticize the regime.

The press products of these subjects are nothing more than online articles aimed at profiteering, criticizing, distorting, smearing the government, and dividing the people. The most important thing is that they only use the press as a disguise to carry out purposes that are not allowed by law, even going against the interests of the nation and nation.\\n\\nOn January 5, 2021, three members of the so-called \"Vietnam Independent Journalists Association\" were convicted.

Just waiting for that, on social networks, some organizations and individuals immediately reacted with the statement: \"The dream of press freedom is broken\", \"Vietnam arrests independent journalists\"... The operating principle sounds very straightforward as \"Independence of sources - Verification of information-Neutrality with politics\", however, these members spread unverified and untrue information.\\n\\nUnfounded claims that Vietnam does not have internet freedom, misrepresenting press freedom - Photo 14.\\nLooking back at these faces, it can be seen that the path leading them to the horseshoe originates from taking advantage of freedom of speech, freedom of the press for personal gain, or spreading bad news, distorting the truth. , smearing the Party and State, inciting anti-socialism in Vietnam.\\n\\nThe card of freedom, democracy - the cover of hostile forces\\n\\nCriticizing and condemning the Party and State of Vietnam on democracy and human rights, this is nothing new. Standing behind that, if not individuals who oppose democracy and human rights, are also reactionary organizations such as Viet Tan, Viet Dynasty, or organizations that are not sympathetic to Vietnam such as Amnesty International, Freedom House, Human Rights Watch,or Reporters Without Borders RSF.\\n\\nOne of the most noticeable points is that these organizations often rely on one-sided, subjective reports and then draw incriminating conclusions. Freedom of the press only appears in the countries they want, the institutions they like, it has nothing to do with the reality that is happening.\\n\\nFor Vietnam, the fact that such organizations often use the card of freedom and democracy, associated with all aspects of life, including the press, is only to portray Vietnam with a hostile and misleading appearance. which goes against the universal values \\u200b\\u200bof the world. Positive condemnation is that, but do they really care about democracy and human rights in Vietnam? It\\'s just a cover to aim for a completely different goal.\\n\\nTaking the name of an independent organization, the so-called \"Vietnam Human Rights Network\" annually collects a report on the human rights situation in Vietnam. They also set up human rights awards to promote the number of reactionaries, political opportunists, and dissidents in the country.\\n\\nUnfounded claims that Vietnam does not have internet freedom, misrepresenting press freedom - Photo 15.\\nThe \"Vietnam Human Rights Network\" promotes the number of reactionaries, political opportunists, and opponents in the country.\\n\\nBut their real ambition is not to improve human rights for anyone as in their operating principles, but to find ways to disrupt the country, call for international intervention in Vietnam, remove the leadership role. of the Party.\\n\\nPress freedom or democracy and human rights under the hands of hostile forces and reactionary organizations has become one of the spearheads of peaceful development.\\n\\nAfter more than 100 years of war against imperialist aggression, the Vietnamese people have spared no blood and blood in exchange for independence and freedom. More than anyone else, this people understands the measure and value of those freedoms. Including freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\\n\\nThe Party and State of Vietnam have always determined that people are at the center of all policies, considering people as both the driving force and the goal of national construction and development.\\n\\nIn that spirit, protecting human rights is a natural thing that the Party and State will pay attention to and ensure. Thereby also contributing to show the superiority of the regime. However, human rights must be respected, but still cannot be above the law, cannot go against the interests of the nation and nation.\\n\\nTherefore, Vietnam\\'s rhetoric of commercial loans, crying for rent, and screaming for democracy and human rights will not bring any results. In particular, when the truth of the subjects behind have been fully identified, those who speak the language of democracy and human rights are delusional and out of place to attempt to promote peaceful development, towards overthrowing. regime in Vietnam.\\n\\nHowever, our grandparents have a saying \"Fake hair into legs\".

      " '- Sir, how does the Law on Cybersecurity affect people\\'s freedom of speech?\\n+ First, it can be affirmed that the Law on Cybersecurity has absolutely no effect on people\\'s right to freedom of speech. There is no law that provides regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals using new network information like this. Never before has children\\'s rights been so protected on online information. The Law on Cybersecurity emphasizes the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations on network information. People are comfortable using the network to do activities that do not violate the law. There is absolutely no provision to impede free speech.\\nOnly individuals who give false, fabricated, or insulting information according to 29 articles of the Penal Code will be handled. It is impossible to threaten to kill people online and be free, but in reality, they will be punished. It is impossible to freely buy and sell weapons, explosives, detailed instructions on how to use them, but in real life, they will be dealt with, but not on the internet… Who offends the nation, sovereignty, religion, or who discriminates against gender on the internet? …will be dealt with.\\n\\n-Is it mandatory for businesses to disclose personal information to security agencies in violation of personal privacy protection?\\n+ Do not violate anything. Because there is article 17 of the Law already. Article 17 is very strict to protect the privacy of individuals and families. \"Enterprises when providing telecommunications services, internet and value-added services... are responsible for verifying information when users register for digital accounts, and keeping user\\'s account information confidential.\" Therefore, it is the responsibility of the business to maintain confidentiality. Failure to do so will be handled.\\n\"Provide information to users in charge of network security protection upon written request to serve the investigation of violations of the law on network security\". In the event that the Law provides so, it will be provided. For example, when I see an online exchange of buying and selling explosives to prepare for terrorism, the involved party must definitely provide information for us to handle, otherwise a disaster will occur.\\nIn addition, information will not be arbitrarily provided and must be treated as confidential. If you reveal that secret, you will be held responsible. Right now a lot of our information is being leaked.\\n\\n-But the sign of violation seems to be very vague, sir?\\n+ No ambiguity. This issue is referred to in 29 articles of the Criminal Law. If we detect signs of a bomb, we have to arrest it immediately. Information must be requested to verify if the person is true or just fabricated information. And after that, we can handle the law or handle it in another form.\\nAnd I believe that when formulating this, the National Assembly\\'s Committee on Defense and Security and the Law Committee of the National Assembly scrutinized it very carefully.\\n\\n-In the Law, there is a sentence that is quite vague. For example \"insulting great people\". So how to identify \"great man\", sir?\\n+ This must be appraised by relevant functional ministries. If the Ministry replies that there is a violation, we will be handled. For example, related to credit fraud, it is necessary to ask the State Bank and financial economic groups to determine whether there is a violation. There are a lot of people losing money and this has to be verified by a cybersecurity agency. We have to step by step investigate, verify and clarify whether it is subjective, objective, age...\\nOf course, no law is perfect. Someone asked me, \"Does this law prevent acts in cyberspace?\". I replied: \"Criminal Law is enacted, but murder is still there, robbery is still there\". Having a Cybersecurity Law is there to provide scope for what is protected and to know prohibited behavior for us to avoid. Even the agency in charge of cybersecurity must rely on this Law to know what is prohibited and what is allowed.\\n\\n-From now until the decree is formulated, will the editorial board continue to listen to people\\'s opinions, sir?\\n+ The editorial board always listens, always adjusts, always asks for the right content to be submitted. All decrees are commented by agencies, economic groups, and internet telecommunications groups. I affirm so.\\n\\n-During the drafting of the Law on Cybersecurity, did we work with Google…?\\n+ The draft Law on Cybersecurity was developed in November 2016 according to the Resolution of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister then issued a decision to establish a Drafting Committee. Members include many ministries and branches, not only the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Defense, etc. During the construction process, the drafting committee also followed Decree 72 on setting up servers and offices in Vietnam. Then, when submitting the Law on Cybersecurity at the 4th Session of the National Assembly, the National Assembly also asked how to adjust it to suit the recommendations of businesses and internet telecommunications corporations.\\nDuring the drafting process, the drafting team also had the opportunity to approach major telecommunications corporations in the world such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, American Business Association, ASEAN.... Thereby to explain and listen to their opinions on our Cybersecurity billour basil.\\nAfter the two sides worked and agreed, the representatives of those units agreed to adjust their strategies accordingly. The corporations themselves, these units also see our adjustments and regulations as appropriate. It is completely unlikely that Google and Facebook will withdraw from the Vietnamese market. And certainly with a market share like that of Vietnam, currently 48 million Facebook accounts and will certainly be larger, so there is no such thing as rumors. There is absolutely no information about this.'\n",

      " 'Currently, there are many different conceptions and approaches to cyberspace, also known as virtual space. This is an artificial environment, people do not directly meet, but can exchange information and communicate with each other through a network system, which is globally connected - global network, on public infrastructure. Information technology is interdependent across countries, regions, regions and globally. Clause 3, Article 1 of the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity of our country defines: “Cyberspace is the connecting network of information technology infrastructure, including telecommunications networks, internet networks, computer networks, information processing and control system, database; is a place where people perform social behaviors that are not limited by space and time”.\\n\\nResearch on cyberspace and the network environment in our country shows that these two concepts are very close to each other. Clause 3, Article 4 of the Law on Information Technology 2006 defines: “Network environment is the environment in which information is provided, transmitted, collected, processed, stored and exchanged through the infrastructure. information layer”. “Information infrastructure is a system of equipment serving the production, transmission, collection, processing, storage and exchange of digital information, including telecommunications networks, the internet, computer networks, etc. computers and databases” (Clause 4, Article 4, Law on Information Technology).\\n\\nThus, cyberspace or network environment are different, but essentially the same because they are all virtual spaces where people can communicate, connect, exchange and communicate with each other. The development of cyberspace (cyber environment) depends on the information infrastructure in each country. Currently, in Vietnam in particular, in the world in general, cyberspace is very large, the network system being used includes: web browsers (Google, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari...) ; news websites (VnExpress, News, Zing news, VTC News...); social networks (Facebook, Twitter, YuMe, Instagram, Zing me, Youtube, Skype, WeChat, Google Plus, Go.vn...); search, lookup (Google map, Bing, Google Docs...); utilities (money transfer, employment, email, e-card...); Website for buying, selling, doing business, learning, music, entertainment1.\\n\\n2. Rights, obligations, responsibilities and restrictions on rights of individuals and citizens in cyberspace\\n\\nCitizens\\' rights in cyberspace. The network environment is a large space where individuals, citizens and any agency or organization can freely express their opinions, connect and exchange with each other. That is the freedom of the individual: freedom of speech, freedom of information (freedom to seek, receive and exchange information) in the network environment. This is the basic freedom of citizens, which is respected and protected by international law, the Constitution and Vietnamese law.\\n\\nArticle 11, of the 2016 Press Law stipulates the right to freedom of expression in the press (paper press, video press, audio press, electronic press - cyberspace). These rights of citizens include: (1). Expressing opinions on the situation of the country and the world; (2). Participate in the formulation and implementation of guidelines, guidelines and policies of the Party and laws of the State; (3). To give comments, criticisms, recommendations, complaints and denunciations in the press for Party organizations, state agencies, socio-political organizations, socio-political-professional organizations, and organizations. social organizations, socio-professional organizations and other organizations and individuals.\\n\\nSimilar to citizens\\' freedom to express their views and opinions in cyberspace, citizens have the right to access information from the network environment itself. The Law on Access to Information stipulates that citizens have the right to be provided with complete, accurate and timely information; complaints, lawsuits and denunciations of violations of the law on access to information. The Law on Cybersecurity stipulates that one of the principles of cybersecurity protection is to \"ensure human rights and citizens\\' rights, and create conditions for agencies, organizations and individuals to operate in cyberspace\" (Clause 3. , Article 4, Law on Cybersecurity).\\n\\nThus, with the current legal corridor, individuals and citizens have the right to freely use cyberspace for personal benefits; have the right to have their rights and freedoms protected from public authorities and to actively exercise (practice) their personal freedoms in cyberspace.\\n\\nObligations and responsibilities of citizens in cyberspace. In accordance with international standards, each individual and citizen, while using and exercising their rights and freedoms, must have obligations and responsibilities towards the community, society, the nation and people. the tribe in which I live. That is, when using and exercising personal rights and freedoms, they must not affect or infringe on national security; public order, social ethics; the rights and freedoms of others. This issue according to international standards is called limiting human rights to ensure for the common good of society, for the public interest in a democratic society; for reasons of national defense, national security, public order, social morality, and the rights and freedoms of others.\\n\\nConcretizing the principle of restricting the exercise of individual rights and freedoms, the Law on Cybersecurity and other relevant laws has beenregulated by prohibited acts.

International law on human rights\\n\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and two international conventions on human rights in 1966 (Civil and Political Rights Convention - ICCPR; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - ICCPR - International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) ICESCR), together with additional protocols to form the International Code of Human Rights - is the foundation of the current international legal system on human rights. Article 2 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that \"human rights shall not be discriminated against on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, origin or origin. , social status…” 2. At the same time, the obligations and responsibilities of individuals are defined: “1. Everyone has obligations to the community which is the only place in which their own personalities can develop freely and fully. 2. In the enjoyment of his rights and freedoms, everyone is subject only to such limitations as are established by law, in order to ensure due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others, and as to meet the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society”.\\n\\nFrom the principles of rights and obligations and responsibilities stated in the Declaration, the two 1966 Conventions have developed and concretized with specific provisions in the direction of determining which rights must be exercised immediately. These are rights that require the state to guarantee immediate implementation. Because that is the boundary, the \"threshold\" of having or not having human rights - q'\n",

But cyberspace is a complicated place and not a place without the rule of law. Therefore, raising people\\'s awareness about human rights and propagating knowledge about human rights, especially in cyberspace, are also being widely deployed in Vietnam. The purpose is to help people know how to protect their own rights and freedoms, and at the same time respect the rights and freedoms of others in accordance with the requirements and requirements of international law and standards. national human rights law. Mr. Dinh Tien Dung affirmed that, up to now, Vietnam is implementing relatively on schedule and fully implementing the recommendations received and has partly raised the awareness and responsibility for Internet and network users. society.\\n\\nVietnam is currently one of the countries in the world that is implementing the Law on Cybersecurity. After nearly two years of taking effect, the regulations on ensuring information security in cyberspace of Vietnam\\'s Cybersecurity Law have come into life, contributing to the healthy information in the virtual world. create good interaction in many aspects of social life.

However, besides that, each person, country and nation also has to face significant and complex challenges that the internet and social networks bring, especially in terms of information. Because information on the internet, social networks are difficult to verify and are not limited by space.\\n\\nFrom that fact, hostile forces and bad actors have been thoroughly taking advantage of the internet and social networks to infringe on the sovereignty of the national electronic border, spreading false information for dangerous purposes. malicious, despicable, such as: Fraud to appropriate property to mental terrorism - threatening to put personal information and private life online, causing many families to be broken, lives disturbed, even many who still seek death...\\n\\nUp to now, many countries have considered the internet and social networks as a method of communication between the government and the people, in order to promote the role of the people in management and supervision. The Vietnamese government has been following this trend, building e-government from sensitive areas, for example: Customs to solve daily needs of citizens such as identity verification, household registration. … However, the internet and social networks were once the main means of information for anti-government forces-connecting, mobilizing people to perform acts from \"nonviolence\", \"civil disobedience\" to riot, subversion; calling for foreign intervention to \"protect civilians\", \"defend human rights\" from government repression ... This is the scenario of anti-government forces in the Middle East, North Africa in the so-called \"\" Jasmine Revolution” (2010-2011).\\n\\n\\nIllustration/vtv.vn.\\nIn Vietnam, disturbances, infringing on national security, destroying State property, and obstructing law enforcement officials occurred in Binh Thuan, Ho Chi Minh City, etc. under the pretext of opposing the draft law on law. The special zone shows that bad political forces, including foreign countries, have used the internet and social networks to direct thugs, drug addicts, and jobless elements to seek to spread misinformation about This bill is to incite people to take to the streets against the people\\'s government.\\n\\nTherefore, it is necessary to have a strict sanction for the use of the internet and social networks in order to protect national security, social order and safety in cyberspace. That is why the Law on Cybersecurity was passed by the National Assembly of Vietnam with high consensus.\\n\\nHowever, on the internet and social networks, some people have not carefully studied this law, some bad guys have deliberately misrepresented, demanded the rejection of the Cybersecurity Law with vague reasons, or made inferences with the intention of bad. For example, they believe that the Law on Cybersecurity \"invades privacy\"; “infringement on freedom of expression”; \"robbing people\\'s right to use the internet\"… Also on this occasion, during the disturbances and infringing upon national security, the bad guys raised slogans demanding the deletion of the Cybersecurity Law. Many Western news agencies also \"support\" with articles and online \"talks\" to spread misinformation, denying the Law on Cybersecurity. In international relations, they believe that the Law on Cybersecurity will violate Vietnam\\'s agreement to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), violate the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). . Some people are worried that big websites like Google and Facebook will \"leave Vietnam\". So is the Cybersecurity Law aimed at infringing on human rights, citizens\\' rights and restricting international relations - restraining Vietnam\\'s development?\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity consists of 7 chapters and 43 articles. The principles of network security protection are: (1) Complying with the Constitution and laws; ensure the interests of the State, the lawful rights and interests of organizations and individuals; (2) Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the unified management of the State; ... (3) Closely combine the task of protecting network security ... ensuring human rights and citizens\\' rights, creating conditions for organizations and individuals to operate in cyberspace…” (Article 4).\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity only stipulates sanctions for using cyberspace to commit acts against the State, infringing upon the rights and interests of agencies, organizations and individuals.

(6) Taking advantage of or abusing cybersecurity protection activities to infringe upon sovereignty, interests, national security, order, social security, legitimate rights and interestspressure from organizations or individuals or for self-seeking purposes” (Article 8).\\n\\nAre the concerns and worries about the Cybersecurity Law violating the WTO, CPTPP agreements and big network enterprises like Google and Facebook going to leave Vietnam? The answer is “no”.\\n\\nAccording to the report to the National Assembly, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam said that the basic agreements of the WTO (GATT Agreement, GATS Agreement) that Vietnam joins and the CPTPP Agreement have exception provisions on security. security. Accordingly, Vietnam has the right to require domestic and foreign enterprises providing services on telecommunications networks, the internet and services in cyberspace in Vietnam to store important data of service users. in Vietnam - placing a virtual server in Vietnam is completely legal. It is known that so far there have been more than 18 member countries of the WTO (including the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, France) requiring network businesses to store data in their territories.\\n\\nWhat about big websites like Google, Facebook already present in Vietnam? Vietnam is now a big market. According to incomplete statistics, Vietnam currently has 58 million users, an increase of 5% in the first quarter of 2018 and 16% over the same period in 2017. Advertising services, credit card payments are based on the platform. From these networks is a significant source of income for this company… So far, Vietnam is ranked 7th in the world, Ho Chi Minh City is also in the top 6 cities with the largest number of Facebook users. with 14 million users (1). Thus, in the top 10 countries with the largest number of Facebook users in the world, there are 4 countries in Southeast Asia, including: Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.\\n\\nAccording to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, currently, Google and Facebook are storing data of Vietnamese agencies, organizations and individuals in data centers located in Hong Kong (China) and Singapore. If the Law on Cybersecurity comes into effect, it is feasible for these businesses to transfer and store data to Vietnam.\\n\\nThus, in terms of national and national interests, including international relations, the Law on Cybersecurity not only protects and better ensures national independence and national sovereignty (in the electronic space). but also create conditions to better ensure national interests. This is the most important thing for each state in terms of internet, social network is developing like a storm. If individuals and businesses spend a little more money in the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law, they must accept it for the greater and longer-term benefit of the country, after all, it is the benefit of ensuring the security of the country. peace for society, family and for each person.\\n\\nIn terms of rights and interests of individuals, organizations and businesses, the Law on Cybersecurity is completely unrestricted on the rights and interests of the above group of subjects. Because the sanctions of the Cybersecurity Law only apply to criminal acts (through taking advantage of the internet, social networks-Article 8). The Law on Cybersecurity only allows authorities to investigate and clarify the source of malicious information when necessary. However, for those who have been conspiring and planning to take advantage of the internet and social networks to fight against the State of Vietnam or hurt citizens, the Law on Cybersecurity is a strict sanction. .\\n\\nThus, for everyone, there is absolutely no such thing as an \"invasion of privacy\" Law on Cybersecurity; “infringement on freedom of expression”; \"robbing people\\'s right to use the internet\" as someone is distorting and denying.'\n",

However, besides the benefits, cyberspace also poses many risks and challenges, directly affecting the sovereignty, national security and social order and safety, the legitimate rights and interests of the people. organizations and individuals. Politically motivated cyber attacks on key information systems of countries are increasing, causing serious economic, defense and security losses. Cybercriminals are increasingly dangerous with many sophisticated and high-tech tricks, using malicious codes that apply artificial intelligence to attack and infiltrate. Cyberspace is becoming a favorable environment for foreign special agencies, individuals and terrorist organizations to contact, recruit forces, raise funds, spread anti-radical ideology, incite hatred hatred and violence.\\n\\nProtecting national rights, interests and security in cyberspace and responding to new threats from cyberspace has become a global issue, identified as a core and vital content in the process. protection and development in many countries around the world. On that basis, countries have promulgated legal documents and established codes of conduct to regulate behaviors and social relationships in cyberspace, contributing to improving security protection capacity. network and prevent, fight and handle illegal acts in cyberspace. To date, 138 countries (including 95 developing countries) have enacted the Cybersecurity Law. In the past 6 years, 23 countries have enacted more than 40 legal documents and sub-laws on cybersecurity. Typically, in September 2018, the US announced its Cybersecurity Strategy, which identified cyber security threats as the top threat to national security; declares readiness to respond with military measures if national cybersecurity is threatened or attacked. In December 2018, Australia enacted the Cybersecurity Law, which, in addition to emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity, also allows authorities to access encrypted data. of network operators.\\n\\nVietnam is in the group of countries with the fastest internet development in the world, and cyberspace in our country also presents many risks and challenges affecting national security and public order. society as a whole, namely:\\n\\n- Enemy and reactionary forces have increased the use of cyberspace to sabotage ideology, sabotage internal affairs, carry out plots of \"peaceful evolution\", cause national conflicts, incite protests and violence. to transform political institutions in Vietnam.\\n\\n- The problem of fake news, false information, bad news, toxic, damaging the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals is taking place seriously (1).\\n\\n- Our country\\'s network system is in the group of countries facing large-scale, high-intensity, serious and increasingly dangerous cyberattacks.

This act in no way violates or interferes with freedom of expression.”\\n\\nHANDLING OF VIOLATIONS - MANY COUNTRIES THAN VIETNAM\\n\\nIn Singapore, on January 4, 2018, the Cybersecurity Bill was submitted to the National Assembly, with a focus on increasing the power of the Singapore Cybersecurity Authority (CSA) in management. Accordingly, when a cyber attack occurs, the CSA will be allowed to conduct an investigation and have the right to request a report about the cyber attack \"within a few hours\" or face a fine of up to 100,000 VND. Singapore dollars or imprisonment for up to 10 years.\\n\\nIn Thailand, the Government has planned to spend more than 128 million Baht (equivalent to 3 million USD) to equip social network tracking technology; efforts to lobby the National Assembly of this country to pass a new Cybersecurity bill, which requires internet service providers to remove and block sensitive content and websites when requested. The country has also asked Facebook to block about 300 accounts that post comments and materials that defame the Royal Family and the government.\\n\\nOn June 14, 2018, the German website Time (Zeit) published an article \"Incitement on the Internet: a Federal-wide strike against hate comments\", stating that 20 police units in Berlin and nine other states searched apartments and arrested 29 people for allegedly posting hateful comments on the internet calling for criminal behavior. Violators can be criminally prosecuted with a prison term of up to 5 years.\\n\\nGermany\\'s cybersecurity law is currently being implemented and strictly adhered to in accordance with European Union (EU) regulations (in May 2016, the EU and the regulators of social networks signed a code of conduct). to combat hate speech online). Accordingly, the managers of Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are committed to preventing the spread of hateful comments on their social networks, 24 hours after receiving the notice to review and delete. statements with potentially hateful content.\\n\\nThus, the recommendations of US congressmen and congressmen asking Google and Facebook not to remove information at the request of the Vietnamese government are clearly \"paradoxical\" recommendations, rough interference in the law. of other countries as well as the community criteria of social networking sites. In a number of recent transparency reports, Google said that in the last 6 months of 2017, the US had 16,054 requests from Google to disclose user data, Germany 6,960 requests, UK 3,773 requests, France 5,842 requests... ( see transparencyreport.google.com). Similarly, Facebook\\'s transparency report says that in 2017 the US had 47,127 data requests, Canada had 1,334 requests, Brazil had 1,596 requests, India 1,284 requests... (see transparency.facebook.com page) . Meanwhile, requests to provide user data from Vietnamese authorities are very few, even equal to \"0\".\\n\\nIt is normal and common for state authorities to request data about users when necessary, and it is the US that has the biggest request. So what is the basis for US lawmakers and congressmen to oppose Vietnam putting this legitimate regulation into a law to better manage cybersecurity, for the benefit of the community?\\n\\nIf you look carefully at Clause 2, Article 26 of Vietnam\\'s Law on Cybersecurity, one of the responsibilities of an online service provider is defined: “Authentication of information when a user registers a digital account; secure information and user accounts; provide user information to the specialized cyber security force under the Ministry of Public Security upon written request to serve the investigation and handling of violations of the law on network security. Right now this is a very normal regulation, in line with international practice.\\n\\nIn April 2018, Viet Tan terrorist organization published letters from nearly 50 so-called \"civil society organizations, human rights activists and independent media organizations in Vietnam\" to the President. operating Facebook to protest that this social network removed posts and locked accounts. In a reply, Facebook\\'s Asia-Pacific representative affirmed: \"There are times when we have to remove or block access to content because it violates the laws of a certain country, even though it doesn\\'t violate our community standards. We have a well-defined processing procedure that makes no difference for Vietnam compared to the rest of the world.”\\n\\nCOMPATIBILITY WITH INTERNATIONAL RULES ON WOMEN HUMAN RIGHTS\\n\\n  According to Dr. Cao Duc Thai, former director of the Institute for Human Rights Research, Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics, the Law on Cybersecurity not only does not violate human rights but also strengthens the protection of human rights and citizens\\' rights. Article 16 of the Law on Cybersecurity specifically stipulates the protection of information belonging to business secrets, personal secrets, family secrets and private life in cyberspace. This is a specific provision in Clause 1, Article 14 of the 2013 Constitution, according to which, “human rights, civil rights in political, civil, economic, cultural and social fields are recognized and respected. respect, protect and ensure in accordance with the Constitution and the law.” The Law on Cybersecurity also specifically stipulates that the case where the specialized network security force has access to user information is when serving the investigation and handling of violations of the law on network security. This provision is consistent with the content of Clause 2, Article 14 of the 2013 Constitution: \"Human rights and citizens\\' rights can only be restricted according to the provisions of the law in case of necessity for reasons of national defense and security. family, social order, safety, social ethics, community health\". It should be remembered: In order to prevent the exploitation of the universality of human rights to interfere in the internal affairs of countries, the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna (Austria) agreed on the view of human rights. Human rights are both universal (universal) or universal, and at the same time, specific, i.e. characteristics due to historical traditions, customs and cultures in the specified regions or in each country. Human rights are expressed through the specificity and uniqueness of the national legal system. This is reflected in the concentration of “restriction of rights” provisions in certain laws. These restrictions are intended to “protect national security; public order; health or morals, or the rights and freedoms of others”.\\n\\nEnemy forces often distort the concept of human rights to encourage and incite the recklessness and delusion of a part of internet and social network users, especially young people. They claim that human rights are rights without any restrictions; all acts against the regime in a “peaceful” and “nonviolent” manner are legal; The authorities\\' suppression of crime is a \"violation of human rights\"… These tones, combined with the lack of understanding, make some people misunderstand about human rights, leading to law violations, falling into labor'\n",

However, due to lack of alertness, many people have acted in violation of the law. Specifically: June 9 - June 11, 2018, in a number of provinces and cities: Binh Thuan, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Khanh Hoa, Binh Duong, Dong Nai with the support of the protest organization Viet Tan movement, extremists have organized marches and demonstrations...\\n\\nMost seriously, in Binh Thuan province, protesters surrounded and stormed the headquarters of the Provincial People\\'s Committee, burned a number of cars and motorbikes, blocked National Highway 1A, causing injuries to people. police force on duty...\\n\\nOn June 9, 2018, Binh Duong Provincial Police discovered and detained Tran Minh Hue (37 years old, from Thanh Hoa) and Nguyen Dinh Thanh (27 years old, from Nghe An) for printing documents, calling calling people to the streets to protest illegally, disrupting security and order.\\n\\nAt the time of being caught, Hue was spreading leaflets at Song Than Industrial Park, Di An town, Binh Duong province. The police agency has seized thousands of documents calling for people to protest, against the consideration of leasing land as a special economic zone. At the security investigation agency, Hue admitted to following the direction of outside reactionary organizations.\\n\\nOn June 10, 2018, the police of Ho Chi Minh City and some localities seized many banners of workers, workers gathered to march illegally; detain a number of people for the act of enticing people to participate in demonstrations. On June 11, 2018, Binh Thuan Provincial Police temporarily detained 102 people who smashed the headquarters of the Provincial People\\'s Committee and agencies in the area.\\n\\nThe extremists incited people to gather in large numbers, disrupted social order when arrested by the functional forces, showed a very apologetic attitude and confessed that they acted because they had received money from the organizations. foreign office.\\n\\nViewpoints of the Party, Government, and National Assembly\\n\\nThe Party, Government and National Assembly highly appreciate the people\\'s interest in comments, discussions, and constitutions, including social criticism of the Party\\'s guidelines, policies, and laws. law of the State.\\n\\nIn the Document of the 11th National Party Congress emphasized: \"The Party respects autonomy, supports all voluntary, active, creative activities and sincerely listens to the contributions of the Front and its unions. The Party and State have mechanisms and policies to create conditions for the Front and mass organizations to operate effectively and perform the role of social supervision and criticism.\\n\\nThe document of the 12th National Congress of our Party continues to affirm: \"The Fatherland Front plays a pivotal role in gathering and mobilizing the people, promoting the patriotic emulation movement, and promoting the great unity of the whole people. people, implement democracy, strengthen social consensus; supervise and criticize society; participate in Party and State building, people\\'s foreign affairs, contributing to the construction and defense of the Fatherland.\\n\\nBefore approving the Law on Special Administrative - Economic Units Van Don, Bac Van Phong, Phu Quoc; The Law on Cybersecurity, the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has published and widely commented. The ideology of the leaders of the Party and the State as well as the content of the Law all show the consistent, do not develop the economy at all costs.\\n\\nBased on the voters\\' suggestions, the Government and the National Assembly Standing Committee (UBTVQH), on the morning of June 11, 2018, the 5th session of the XIV National Assembly voted to agree. time delay passed the Law on Special Administrative - Economic Units Van Don, Bac Van Phong and Phu Quoc. Facing the complicated situation of security and order in some localities, National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan called on people to calm down, avoid extreme actions, and trust in the decisions of the Party. Government.\\n\\nSome missions next time\\n\\nIt is forecasted that in the coming time in Ha Tinh province, reactionary subjects will continue to incite people to oppose the draft Law on Special Administrative-Economic Units, the Law on Cybersecurity; taking advantage of a number of obstacles in the settlement of compensation for damage to people in sea areas... to incite people to gather. They will intensify their sabotage activities on many fronts, in many locations; destabilizing the situation of security, order and social safety, potentially causing damage to the economy - society, national defense - security, negatively affecting the ideology and feelings of cadres and party staff and people...\\n\\nAccordingly, for each cadre, party member and people of all classes, it is necessary to be aware of the content and meaning of the draft Law on Administrative Units and the Law on Cybersecurity. The construction of a special economic zone and the promulgation of the Law on Cybersecurity is an inevitable trend of the world in an integrated and developed economy.

The explosive development of breakthrough technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of things, quantum computers, cloud computing, big data systems, fast data systems... Cyberspace has profoundly changed in both quality and quantity, which is expected to bring unprecedented benefits to human society but also create enormous potential dangers. Many countries are well aware of the threats to cyber security, consider this a new challenge, a new threat of high importance and danger, so they have concretized it into policy documents and documents. legal documents such as laws or sub-law documents in more than 80 countries, organizations and international alliances such as the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, France, Canada, Korea, NATO... to create institutions , the legal basis against threats to national security from cyberspace; establish specialized forces on cyber security, cyber intelligence, cyber warfare, cyber-terrorism and cybercrime prevention. In just the past 6 years, 23 countries around the world have enacted more than 40 legal documents on cybersecurity.\\nIn our country, the strong application and development of information technology in all fields of life has greatly contributed to speeding up the process of industrialization and modernization of the country, economic, cultural and social development. society, improve the quality of health care and education, promote the people\\'s creativity and mastery, and maintain security and national defense. However, there are still shortcomings and limitations in cybersecurity that need to be overcome such as: (1) The national potential for cybersecurity in our country is not strong enough, has not been mobilized and exploited synergy to deal with cyber threats. (2) Cyberspace and some types of information technology services and applications are being used by hostile and reactionary forces to carry out plots to conduct a \"color revolution\", \"street revolution\". \", \"peaceful evolution\" aimed at abolishing the political regime in our country. Posting false information, humiliating and slandering organizations and individuals is rampant in cyberspace without effective management measures, leading to many unfortunate consequences in terms of human life, morale, even affect sovereignty, interests, national security, social order and safety. (3) There are more and more large-scale and high-intensity cyber attacks, increasing in severity and danger level, directly threatening national security and social order and safety. Cyber \\u200b\\u200bterrorism emerges as a serious threat to national security. Criminal activities in cyberspace are increasing in number of cases and sophisticated tricks causing serious economic damage, affecting ideology, culture and society. (4) Information systems critical to national security have not been identified and protected by adequate measures. Because the content of cybersecurity incidents has not been determined, when dangerous incidents occur, affecting sovereignty, interests, national security, social order and safety, the implementation of response activities, handling and overcoming consequences of relevant authorities is very confused, there is no unified process, the agency responsible for network security protection has not been able to actively implement appropriate measures and plans. . (5) The situation of leaking state secrets through cyberspace is very worrying, many documents belonging to state secrets are published on cyberspace. One of the important reasons leading to this situation is the limited awareness of agencies, businesses and individuals about protecting state secrets in cyberspace, the sense of responsibility of many officials, staff in information security in cyberspace is not high enough, sanctions are not enough deterrent. (6) Dependence on information technology equipment originating from abroad. Cyberspace is widely applied in all areas of social life, however, the dependence on information technology equipment originating from abroad is a potential threat to network security if it occurs. out conflict. In order to avoid being attacked by hackers, information gathering, intelligence activities, some network products and services need to meet certain standards and regulations, especially when these products and services are used by hackers. used in important information systems and national security, cipher and confidential locations, containing state secrets.

      " \"In the early days of 2018, domestic and international media simultaneously reported on the scandal that shocked the world, that is, 87 million Facebook accounts were exposed and illegally shared to the Company. company Cambridge Antica for commercial and political use, leading to an urgent investigation by the United States and the European Union.\\nThat shows, not only the US, UK and many other countries around the world are very interested in personal data, privacy on social networks includes both aspects of collection and protection. User data is considered as a national asset, the value brought from this data is not only in the economic and political fields but also in national security. Therefore, in Vietnam, the Draft Law on Cybersecurity requires foreign agencies and organizations providing services in cyberspace and owning information systems in Vietnam to store Vietnamese user data and other important data required by the Government of Vietnam is required. Benefits for businesses and authorities According to the draft Law on Cybersecurity, stored data will not cover all businesses, nor require restrictions, storing all data in Vietnam, but only applied in necessary cases, for reasons of national defense and security. Data storage is not a business condition for enterprises. Because only user data and important national data of Vietnam are stored, it is not fundamental data (for example, source data of software), so it does not affect and hinder the circulation of   data flow”, does not create barriers for businesses to participate in the economy of Vietnam. When foreign agencies and organizations provide services in cyberspace and own information systems in Vietnam that store data, Vietnamese authorities will coordinate with the above agencies and businesses. building tools including: Monitoring tool for the exploitation of user data and sharing it with third parties (whether the above-mentioned foreign agencies and organizations exploit big data of Vietnamese users or share for third parties need to be properly supervised according to the provisions of Vietnamese law and the commitments of these agencies and organizations to users). National security threat trends analysis tool (provides the ability to track trends in activities that threaten national security, such as calling for, recruiting terrorists, etc.) announcement; inciting protests; causing religious and political conflicts). Crime verification tool (provides information that helps Vietnamese law enforcement agencies to easily and quickly look up information of cyber users who commit violations) crime, location retrieval, evidence collection) and a number of other specialized tools for national security protection to manage this data. In the draft Law on Cybersecurity, there is no provision to prevent foreign enterprises from investing and participating in economic activities. Vietnam. The requirement to store user data and other important data in Vietnam does not affect or hinder foreign businesses operating in Vietnam. During the drafting process, Google, Facebook, and Amazon asked to work with the Drafting Committee and the Editorial Team of the Law project. In the content of the meetings, no company has confirmed that the requirement to store data is to prevent foreign businesses from investing or doing business in Vietnam. Facebook has agreed to coordinate with Vietnamese authorities and expressed its intention to set up a representative office but has not been able to do so due to procedural problems. Google has shared data management and information handling policies that violate the law. The Asian Cloud Computing Association (ACCA), whose core is Amazon, has exchanged documents on user data management policies by level and country-critical data of several countries. However, stemming from business interests, do not want to be governed by the laws of the host country, do not want to pay taxes and bear related obligations, after the draft Law on Cybersecurity was submitted for comments. Widely among the people, foreign telecommunications and internet service providers have commented on a number of contents related to the requirement that these enterprises must store user data and data in Vietnam. important data of Vietnam to create a  back effect  to promote communication, attract public opinion and influence policy on the draft Law on Cybersecurity. They even think that restricting the flow of data has consequences for economic development, which can reduce GDP by 1.7% and reduce foreign investment by 3.1% in Vietnam. In fact, this is information released by businesses that are doing business but do not pay taxes, and have not increased GDP for the country for many years. The purpose of these companies is to hinder the issuance of policies on cybersecurity, to facilitate these businesses to operate without the constraints of the law, to slow down the tax obligations. Not only in Vietnam, in order to deal with the strict management activities of countries around the world for social networks and technology services recently, a number of US companies led by Google, Facebook, etc. , Amazon ... have attracted and lobbied a number of other companies such as ACCA (a global accounting training and certification company), AIC (Asian Internet Alliance), UPS (a courier company specializing in providing accounting services). professional global warehousing and transportation services for goods, finance, information to more than 200 countries) organized a seminar to share views and discuss strategies to deal with ASEAN countries, important The focus is on Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. In January 2018, this group held a workshop to discuss the following issues: Legal challenges for e-commerce operators in ASEAN (presented by AIC representative); Legal challenges in selected markets including Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia (presented by Facebook, Google and Visa); Campaign “Frequently Asked Questions and Advocacy Channels”. These companies have coordinated with the embassies of a number of countries in Vietnam such as the US, Canada, Australia, the EU, and Japan to send comments on the draft Law to the President of the National Assembly, Vice Chairmen of the National Assembly, Committees of the National Assembly, the State President, the Prime Minister and relevant ministries and branches. Simultaneously, in collaboration with the US-ASEAN Business Council, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), the Internet Asia Alliance, the Business Software Alliance (BSA), the Computer Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), ), the European Association of Digital Organizations (DIG ITALEUROPE), Information Technology Industry Council, Japan Electronics and Information Technology Association (JEITA), American Semiconductor Industry Association, VISA and Mastercard Corporation, Asia Cloud Computing Association Asia (ACCA) organized discussions, seminars, and comments on the draft Law on Cybersecurity. Notably, in addition to requesting to work with Vietnamese authorities, including the Ministry of Public Security, the above companies also proposed to coordinate with the National Defense and Security Committee to organize a seminar, but because they did not meet the requirements of the Ministry of Public Security. was approved, so it has coordinated with domestic socio-professional organizations such as Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), Vietnam Digital Media Association (VDCA) to organize discussions and seminars on building drafted the Law on Cybersecurity (November-2017, March to May 2018), stating analyzes contrary to the actual situation, detrimental to state management policy through easy reasons. approved by the public such as  concerns about effectiveness ,  legislators still have limited awareness of cyber security ,  transmit businesses' words , thereby proposing to  delay the time of passing draft Law on Cybersecurity”. Meanwhile, these agencies do not hold direct working sessions with the drafting agency or the verifying agency to propose and propose corrections. Despite making many unfavorable recommendations for the draft Law on Cybersecurity such as hindering the circulation of digital data, affecting the development of the digital economy, affecting businesses, arising administrative procedures, etc. but these enterprises did not indicate the basis for making those conclusions. Most of them are personal subjective conclusions, not based on scientific grounds. In particular, these conclusions do not stand on Vietnam's position in protecting national security, social order and safety.\"\n",

      " \"Keeping up with the requirement to set up a representative office in Vietnam\\n\\nReporting on explaining, absorbing and revising the draft Law on Cybersecurity, Chairman of the National Defense and Security Committee Vo Trong Viet said that at the 4th session of the XIV National Assembly, the National Assembly deputies (Deputies of the National Assembly) ) discussed and commented on the Cybersecurity Law project. After the meeting, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly (the Standing Committee of the National Assembly) directed the study, acceptance and revision of the draft Law according to the process.\\n\\nRegarding ensuring information security in cyberspace for foreign enterprises when providing telecommunications and internet services in Vietnam, he said there are many different opinions on this issue.\\n\\nIn which, many opinions agree that it is mandatory for foreign enterprises when providing telecommunications and internet services in Vietnam to set up a representative agency or server to manage Vietnamese user data in Vietnam.\\n\\nSome opinions disagree with this regulation, because they think that it is difficult to ensure the feasibility, is not true to reality, increases the costs of foreign enterprises, makes it difficult to access information and contrary to international commitments to which Vietnam is a member... it is recommended to study other management methods accordingly.\\n\\nVo Trong Viet said that the Standing Committee of the National Assembly found that this content had many different opinions, some foreign ambassadors in Vietnam and some organizations had comments. The Standing Committee of the National Assembly has directed relevant agencies to organize conferences to discuss and exchange with ambassadors, clarifying relevant recommendations.\\n\\nAfter considering many aspects, and at the same time referring to similar provisions of the laws of some countries that are members of the WTO, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly adjusted as follows: Regarding the requirement to set up a data management server in the territory of Vietnam, Receiving comments from the National Assembly deputies, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly has directed not to stipulate this content in the draft Law to ensure the feasibility and convenience for the operation of foreign enterprises when providing services to Vietnam.\\n\\nRegarding the requirement to set up a representative agency and store Vietnamese user data in the Vietnamese territory, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly proposed to keep this content in the draft Law and combine it with similar regulations for domestic enterprises.\\n\\nChairman Vo Trong Viet analyzed that such regulation would have many advantages. First of all, meeting the requirements of protecting national sovereignty over electronic data and handling situations and acts in cyberspace that infringe upon national security, social order and safety; attaching obligations and responsibilities of domestic and foreign agencies and organizations in providing information and data for investigation, verification, handling of violations, and preventing and removing anti-Party and State information water in cyberspace.\\n\\nThis provision is also consistent with international treaties to which Vietnam is a contracting party, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic Rights. social and cultural, the Basic Agreements of the WTO; in accordance with the 2013 Constitution and meet the requirements of the current practical situation.\\n\\nOn the other hand, creating a legal corridor for functional ministries and branches to strictly manage the activities of enterprises providing cross-border services into Vietnam; ensure payment sovereignty, prevent tax loss.\\n\\nAt the same time, ensuring fairness between foreign enterprises and domestic enterprises.\\nSpeaking at the National Assembly Hall, many delegates not only expressed their opinions but also used the right to debate to discuss this issue.\\n\\nDelegate Cao Dinh Thuong (Phu Tho) expressed his high agreement with the passing of the cybersecurity law to prevent and respond to threats to network security. Delegates agreed with the regulation that foreign enterprises, when providing services in cyberspace or owning information systems in Vietnam, must have their headquarters or representative offices in Vietnam. According to the delegate, the above provisions will be useful if implemented in order to control data and users for investigation, crime prevention, and counter-revolutionary misrepresentation.\\n\\nHowever, the delegate wondered, if the foreign business side does not implement, what is the solution, is it to stop providing services in the territory of Vietnam? From there, the delegate suggested that there should be regulations in line with Vietnam's reality, as well as Vietnam's commitments to foreign countries and international law.\\n\\nAccording to the delegate, in order to ensure cyber security in Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Government Cipher Committee have very heavy responsibilities. Therefore, the Drafting Committee needs to review and clearly define the responsibilities of each agency, the responsibility for coordination so as not to overlap and easily implement in practice.\\n\\nDelegate Pham Thi Thanh Thuy (Thanh Hoa) also said that it is very necessary to develop a law on cyber security in the context of information technology development, approaching the industrial revolution 4.0. However, the delegate suggested that some provisions should be considered to avoid unnecessary overlap in state management; avoid creating too many barriers leading to compliance burden for agencies, organizations and individuals providing services; obstruct or limit the benefits of enjoying good and legitimate services of Vietnamese people.\\n\\nThrough studying the draft Law on Cybersecurity, the delegates paid special attention to the regulations that require foreign agencies and organizations when providing services in cyberspace in Vietnam to set up a representative office in Vietnam. .\\n\\nThe delegate frankly expressed his opinion:  This request is difficult to be feasible, not suitable for the actual situation, increases the costs of businesses and makes it difficult for the people to access information. Vietnam in case foreign enterprises do not set up their headquarters or representative offices in Vietnam”.\\n\\nAccording to the delegate, at present, the servers of services that many Vietnamese people use regularly, such as Google, Facebook, etc., are located abroad. With current development technology, the server is not a specific machine, but according to the cloud algorithm, the server is a virtual machine, allowing users to access technology services from a certain provider, trend This direction is the forward trend, including our country. From this fact, it is required that foreign agencies and organizations, when providing services in cyberspace in Vietnam, set up their headquarters or representative offices in Vietnam to manage servers and data management. Vietnamese users are not feasible.\\n\\nDelegates also analyzed, if foreign enterprises do not comply with this regulation, they may not be allowed to provide services in Vietnam, greatly affecting the access to information and use of services of the foreigner. people, especially in the context that our country does not have any brands to meet the needs of people to access information and use services.\\n\\nAnother reason given by the delegate was that, in the commitment of the World Trade Organization, telecommunications services provided across borders are services that do not restrict market access, except in some specific cases, but in those excluded cases, there is no requirement to set up a representative office or representative office in the territory of Vietnam. The commitments in the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement that Vietnam has signed are also similar.  Therefore, if the provisions of the bill are not consistent with the commitments that Vietnam has signed,  the delegate affirmed.\\n\\nContrary to the above view, delegate Nguyen Hong Van (Phu Yen) emphasized that it is very necessary for foreign enterprises to set up a representative office in Vietnam when providing telecommunications and internet services in Vietnam. . This will ensure national sovereignty, contribute to strict management of activities of enterprises providing cross-border services to Vietnam;  Youtube has representative offices in about 80 countries, Google also has about 70 addresses in the world,  the delegate added.\\n\\nIn addition to the above content, the National Assembly deputies gave opinions on handling acts of using cyberspace infringing upon sovereignty, national security, social order and safety; on appraisal, examination, assessment and supervision of cybersecurity of information systems important to national security; measures to protect network security…/.\\n\"\n",

Ensuring human rights is an urgent requirement, requiring both the fight against crime and the building of a synchronous legal corridor, ensuring the prevention and handling of law violations. about personal information; at the same time, ensuring compliance with the Constitution, provisions of Vietnamese law as well as international law.\\n\\nVietnam now has a basic legal framework on protection of personal information and data. The 2013 Constitution and the legal system of Vietnam in general have created the necessary foundation to protect the rights to information and data of individuals. The current law on handling administrative violations has regulations on sanctioning for a number of violations related to personal data protection with the highest fine of 70 million VND.\\n\\nArticle 159 and Article 288 of the 2015 Penal Code provide for the crime of “infringing upon the secret or safety of correspondence, telephone, telegraph or other forms of exchange of private information of others”, “unlawfully giving or using license for information on computer networks and telecommunications networks” can be sentenced to between 3 and 7 years of imprisonment. However, these two crimes have not been specifically and directly related to the current violations of the law related to personal information and data.\\n\\nEspecially, the 2018 Law on Cybersecurity clearly shows the spirit of the Constitution, the Party's guidelines and policies, and the State's laws on respecting and protecting human rights.\\n\\nThe principle of the Law on Cybersecurity is clearly expressed right from the concept that  Cybersecurity is the assurance that activities in cyberspace do not cause harm to national security, social order and safety, rights and interests of the people.  legitimate interests of agencies, organizations and individuals” (Clause 1, Article 2). The Cybersecurity Law protects the right to life, freedom and personal security; the right to equality before the law and to be protected by the law; protect the right to privacy, family, residence or correspondence.\\n\\nThe Law on Cybersecurity protects the right not to be infringed upon personal honor or reputation, which prohibits acts that may infringe upon the honor or reputation of others, and at the same time protects the right to freedom of thought, belief and citizens' religion. The law also protects citizens' right to freedom of speech and expression.\\n\\nTo reduce the risk of being affected by identity theft, prevent cyberattacks, cybercrime, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, strengthen the protection of information and personal data of citizens, it is necessary to carry out many synchronous solutions, including completing the legal system on information and personal data management.\\n\\nOn March 7, 2019, the Government issued Resolution No. 17/NQ-CP on a number of key tasks and solutions for the development of e-Government in the period of 2019-2020, orientation to 2025, in which assigned the Ministry of Public Security to assume the prime responsibility for formulating and submitting to the Government a draft Decree on protection of personal data.\\n\\nThis is a key task, ensuring the legal element for the implementation of the protection of information and personal data in our country and ensuring the operation of the e-Government.\\n\"\n",

At the same time, the report also provides 3 appendices on the so-called  list of prisoners of conscience detained in 2020-2021 ; “list of prisoners of conscience still in captivity” and “Vietnam Human Rights Award 2020”…\\n\\nStill the wrong perspective\\n\\nOnce again, the contents of the report that  Vietnam Human Rights Network  released in the year 2020-2021 all reflect false, unobjective, distorted reality on human rights issues and interfere with human rights issues. internal affairs in Vietnam. The report said that, after more than 5 years from the date of joining the United Nations Human Rights Council, to the periodical review in 2019 according to the assessment of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Vietnam's legal framework  still remains is not compatible with the International Covenant and Vietnam continues to violate fundamental rights, ranging from discrimination, arbitrary arrest and detention, to violations of guarantees of a fair trial to restrictions on freedom. religion, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of association .\\n\\nAs an organization established in 1997, based in the United States,  Vietnam Human Rights Network  operates under the name of  gathering a number of individuals and organizations engaged in the field of fighting and protecting human rights.  human rights and freedoms to which all Vietnamese people are entitled as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments”.\\n\\nHowever, in fact, the reports they give out every year are against the purpose and principles of their activities, the content of the report is misleading, reflects in a one-sided, unobjective and transparent way about the situation. the reality of democracy and human rights in Vietnam.\\n\\nLegal and objective practice on human rights in Vietnam\\n\\nIn the guidelines, lines, policies and laws of the Party and State so far, human rights and the law on human rights are very important content, specified in the legal system. Vietnam. The Constitutions of 1946, 1959, 1980, 1992 and especially the 2013 Constitution institutionalized the Party's views on human rights, fundamental rights and obligations of citizens, in line with Vietnamese practice and standards. international standards on human rights to which Vietnam has joined.\\n\\nThe 2013 Constitution includes 11 chapters and 120 articles, of which Chapter II alone has 36 articles regulating human rights, basic rights and obligations of citizens.

At the same time, in order to ensure human rights in all areas of social life, the legal system on human rights has also been supplemented and perfected such as the promulgation of the Press Law; Law on Belief and Religion; Law on Access to Information; Cybersecurity Law…\\n\\nIn addition to perfecting the legal system to ensure human rights, Vietnam has also joined most of the most important and basic international conventions on human rights and have been codified. Specifically, joining the 4 Geneva Conventions of International Humanitarian Law in 1957 (improving the condition of wounded and sick soldiers of the armed forces fighting on the ground; improving the condition of wounded and sick soldiers and other wounded soldiers). shipwrecks of the armed forces at sea; treatment of prisoners of war; protection of civilians in times of war).\\n\\nJoin the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, signed on 24 September 1982; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, signed on December 18, 1982; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, signed on 19 March 1982; Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed on 20 February 1990; Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed on October 22, 2007; participated in the establishment of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, signed on October 23, 2009, and the ASEAN Committee on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children (ACWC), on April 7, 2010.. .\\n\\nIn recent years, human rights have been clearly and specifically enshrined in the Constitution and laws of Vietnam.

Human rights, civil rights in politics, civil, economic, socio-cultural are recognized, respected, protected and guaranteed according to the Constitution and laws. Achievements in ensuring and respecting human rights and The high quality of enjoyment of human rights by all people is demonstrated in all fields, in all conditions and circumstances, and has been recognized and appreciated by the international community and the United Nations.\\n\\nFor example, Vietnam is one of six United Nations member states that have completed most of the Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule in 2015 and is considered a good example of the international community in practice. implementing the goal of inclusive development, leaving no one behind of the United Nations.\\n\\nThe Economist magazine in August 2020 ranked Vietnam in the top 16 most successful emerging economies in the world. In 2019, Vietnam was honored to be in the top 10 of the list of the most worth living and working countries in the world.

At the 73rd session, at the United Nations headquarters on June 7, 2019, the United Nations General Assembly elected Vietnam as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. the number of votes is close to absolute (192/193 votes).\\n\\nRecently, Vietnam has successfully fulfilled its role as the President of the United Nations Security Council in January and April 2021 with many imprints and contributions, including the issue of ensuring human rights before the COVID-19 pandemic. -19 is recognized and appreciated by the international community and demonstrates Vietnam's increasing international prestige and position.\\n\\nAchievements in ensuring human rights in Vietnam in the fields of cultural, social and economic life, especially Vietnam's achievements in COVID-19 prevention and control and ensuring the right to life is a high right. The COVID-19 pandemic is the clearest evidence in ensuring human rights in the face of events and pandemics that people all over the world have to go through.\\n\\nVietnam has no so-called  prisoners of conscience .\\n\\nIn the report of the Vietnam Human Rights Network, there is also an appendix on the so-called  list of prisoners of conscience detained in 2020-2021 ;  list of prisoners of conscience still imprisoned ... However, this is just a conspiracy and a trick to take advantage of issues of ethnicity, belief, religion, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. , a meeting that the Vietnam Human Rights Network uses to oppose Vietnam. Vietnam does not have so-called  prisoners of conscience  but only citizens who violate Vietnamese laws are arrested, prosecuted and tried; Subjects are arrested and handled for violating Vietnamese law, investigated and tried in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code, prisoners in prisons are guaranteed their rights as prescribed by law. .\\n\\nThose whom the Human Rights Network calls  prisoners of conscience  such as Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Pham Chi Dung, Le Huu Minh Tuan, Nguyen Thuy Hanh, Pham Doan Trang, Le Trong Hung, Doan Kien Giang, Nguyen Phuoc Trung Bao, Can Thi Theu, Trinh Ba Phuong, Trinh Ba Tu, Nguyen Van Hoa... in fact, these are the subjects who abuse the right to freedom of speech and press, using social networks to infringe on national security, social order, promoting propaganda against the country. Every year, the Vietnam Human Rights Network also offers a so-called “Human Rights Award” to “honor” those who are caught and prosecuted for breaking the law.\\n\\nAll individuals and organizations that violate Vietnamese law will of course be subject to the handling of Vietnamese law and that is also the proof in ensuring equality of rights, obligations and responsibilities. of each individual or organization. Therefore, listing the list of  prisoners of conscience  or the so-called  Vietnam Human Rights Award  every year is just a trick that the Vietnam Human Rights Network or some organizations like RSF, AI , Freedom House... took advantage of it to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs. And clearly, once again, they proved the opposite and out of tune in their approach to human rights issues in Vietnam.\\n\"\n",
      " 'Vietnam’s recently adopted Law on Cyber Security does not undermine the people’s rights to freedom of speech and expression but rather facilitates the ability for its citizens to legally exercise those rights, said Vo Van Thuong, head of the Vietnamese Party’s Central Commission for Propaganda and Education. Thuong’s comments were made in a speech given to voters in the southern province of Dong Nai on Wednesday afternoon. According to Thuong, also a member of the country’s lawmaking National Assembly, continuing advances in information technology demand the development of legislation to govern cyberspace and safeguard national security, social order, safety, and the legal rights of Internet users. “I must underline the fact that the Law on Cyber Security does not infringe upon citizens’ rights to freedom of speech and expression,” Thuong said. “By contrast, it actually facilitates the legal exercise of these very same rights. “Everybody reserves the right to speak their mind, but it must conform to provisions of the law. Freedom is not doing whatever we like,” he explained. Last Tuesday, Vietnam’s legislature voted overwhelmingly to pass a law on cyber security that regulates all activities that “protect national security and ensure public safety and order on the Internet.  The 43-article law, divided into seven chapters, will come into effect on January 1, 2019. <em>A working session of Vietnam’s lawmaking National Assembly on June 12, 2018.

Photo: Quochoi.vn The legislation requires all foreign Internet-based service providers to open representative offices and data centers in Vietnam, where the information of their Vietnam-based users must be stored. An article in the law grants the country’s Ministry of Public Security the power to demand access to any organization or company’s data system for investigation into cases where there is a perceived threat to national security and public safety. Online services, including Facebook, Google, and YouTube, will be required to remove ‘anti-state,’ ‘offensive’ or ‘instigating’ content from their platforms within 24 hours of receiving a request from the ministry, according to the law. Nguyen Phu Trong, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, also stressed the significance of the cyber security law when he met with voters in Hanoi on Sunday. “There are people who take advantage of the Internet to instigate protests and disruptive behavior aimed at overthrowing the government,” he said. “We need this law to protect this regime,” he stressed.'\n",
      " 'The enforcement of Vietnam’s cyber security law, which was adopted this week by its legislature, is “critically necessary” in the current context, foreign ministry spokesperson Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters on Thursday. Hang made the remark at a regular press briefing in Hanoi in response to a reporter’s question about the recently adopted Law on Cyber Security. Passed on Tuesday with an overwhelming majority of votes from Vietnamese lawmakers, the 43-article law regulates activities to “protect national security and ensure social order and safety in cyberspace” while stipulating the responsibility of agencies, organizations, and individuals. Hang said the law was voted for and adopted after “many rounds of discussion” which took into account feedback from members of the country’s lawmaking National Assembly and the public in a “comprehensive and transparent” manner. “[The law] is in conformity with the Constitution and will not hamper the implementation of the international treaties to which Vietnam is party,” she stressed. The spokesperson noted how cyber security is an important issue that greatly affects national security and highlighted that it has become a special concern of many countries and organizations, both international and regional, in recent years. Cyber attacks are increasing exponentially, both in form and scale, transcending national borders and leaving serious impacts on the economic and political stability of a country, she said. “Meanwhile, efforts to improve security in the online environment are still faced with numerous challenges, particularly due to the lack of legal institutions and capability to ensure cyber security,” Hang explained. “Therefore, the enforcement of the Law on Cyber Security is critically necessary in the current context,” she stressed. The National Assembly passed the cyber security law with 86.86 percent in favor on Tuesday. The piece of legislation requires all foreign providers of Internet-related services to open representative offices and data centers in Vietnam, where information of Vietnam-based users must be stored, in order to continue offering their services to local users. An article in the law grants the country’s Ministry of Public Security the power to demand access to any organization or company’s data system for investigation in cases where there is a perceived threat to national security and public safety. Internet service providers, including popular platforms like Facebook, Google and YouTube that are used by millions in Vietnam, will be required to remove ‘anti-state,’ ‘offensive’ or ‘inciting’ contents from their sites within 24 hours of receiving a request from the ministry, according to the law. Over half of Vietnam’s population of 92 million have access to the Internet, according to a 2017 report by the Ministry of Information and Communications.'\n",
      " 'In addition to direct costs to handle the crisis, repair systems and pay for lawyers, cyber attacks could also result in reduced confidence among customers, affecting enterprises’ business activities, Dung added. The Viet Nam Institute of Directors (VIOD) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) held a seminar titled ‘Cyber resilience for the board of directors’ in Ha Noi on Thursday. According to attendees at the seminar, cyber threats are intensifying in Asia. Hackers are 80 per cent more likely to attack organisations in Asia, while nearly 80 per cent of internet users in Asia have not received training on cyber security. Total economic losses are estimated to reach US$1.75 trillion, accounting for 7 per cent of Asia Pacific’s gross domestic products (GDP). Cyber attacks might lead to data privacy breaches and losses in confidential information, reputation, customer trust, revenue and jobs, said Sharath Martin, regional policy consultant, ACCA ASEAN & ANZ (Australia – New Zealand). Damage caused by computer viruses caused economic losses of VND12.3 trillion ($540 million) in Viet Nam last year, according to a survey by the security firm BKAV. Digital usage is increasing in Viet Nam, said Martin, as the country has the highest number of registered domains in Asia. The mobile penetration rate stands at 144 per cent, of which, 50 per cent are smartphones. The country’s e-commerce growth was 35 per cent annually. Cyber security Ha Thu Thanh, VIOD’s chairman of the board of directors, said that network security issues should become the top priority for most of business boards. Boards of directors should prioritise cyber security risks as an issue in risk management, not just a technology problem, Thanh said. “Therefore, boards of directors should play a key role in studying cyber security risks associated with their businesses to know that if the prevention and detection of the risks in the businesses were controlled by the businesses’ management systems or not,” Thanh emphasised. Sharath Martin pointed out key insights for boards of directors. Firstly, boards of directors and senior managers should bring cyber security issues into all boardroom topics. The boards should also develop a cyber security strategy, he said. Secondly, the boards should address their cyber defensive frailties. Businesses should have executives responsible for information security. Thirdly, he highlighted the speed of detection and recovery. Lastly, he said that businesses needed to ensure that the investments in information security must keep pace with technology adoption. Within the framework of the seminar, VIOD and ACCA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to increase the two sides’ co-operation in raising awareness and promoting international corporate governance practices to become key factors for the sustainable development of Vietnamese enterprises.'\n",
      " 'The law, which was adopted during the fifth session of the 14th National Assembly and announced by the President on June 28, is comprised of seven chapters and 43 articles, and will become effective from January 1, 2019. The department reported that Vietnam has faced dozens of serious, large-scale cyber attacks over the past few years, directly threatening national security, social order and safety, and seriously affecting the local economy. The latest statistics from the department show that in the first six months of the year, 2,769 websites and online portals with national domains – 35 of which are managed by Party and State agencies – were either hacked, had their interfaces or content altered, or were deprived of administration authority. What is more, the Internet and some digital services and applications have also been used by hostile forces to spread calls for illegal protests and gatherings that may incite rioting or violate national sovereignty, interests, and security. Meanwhile, the dependence on foreign-origin technology devices has led to an urgent need to form a cyber security industry. CSD Director Hoang Phuoc Thuan said that the Law on Cyber Security clarifies cyber security ensures that activities on the Internet do not harm national security, social order and safety, as well as the legitimate rights and interests of organisations and individuals. This is a new issue, demonstrating the National Assembly’s standpoint on protecting the legitimate rights and interests of organisations and individuals in line with national security, said Thuan. Regarding concerns related to the granting of sub-licences to telecommunications and Internet-based companies, Thuan said that the issues were carefully considered alongside consultations with the business community during the building of the law. “There are no obstacles and there will be none of the sub-licences as rumoured,” stated Thuan. Luu Binh Nhuong, standing member of the National Assembly’s Committee on Social Affairs, said that concerns about limited freedom of speech once the law is adopted are baseless as the issue is not regulated in the Law on Cyber Security, but the Civil Code. The law only controls issues related to cyber security and does not prohibit freedom of speech, said he. “Translating the Law on Cyber Security as prohibiting freedom of speech is a misunderstanding and it should not be referred to in that way,” stressed Nhuong, adding that the law only targets cyber criminals. The law only focuses on preventing and combating high-tech and cyber criminals, and matters related to security, and social order and safety are regulated in other laws, he concluded.'\n",
      " 'Vietnamese websites were hit by more than 6,500 cyber security attacks – all either deface, malware or phishing attacks – in the first eight months of 2018. According to a report by the Vietnam Computer Emergency Response Team (VNCERT), approximately 100,000 IP addresses in Vietnam visit or access virus-infected websites daily and security vulnerability is becoming bigger every year. The VNCERT said the frequency of attacks to portals and websites in Vietnam has rose. The largest number of attacks were recorded on the domain name “.vn”, accounting for 44.07 percent, followed by “.com.vn” (36.58 percent) and “.edu.vn” (9.45 percent). Governmental websites registered with a “.gov.vn” domain were struck by 4.72 percent of the total attacks. The most common type of attack was attack to harvest data, making up 70 percent of the total. Securelist.com named Vietnam among top 10 countries hit by distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in the last quarter of 2017 and among the top 10 nations with the highest botnet-assisted DDoS attacks with more than 637,000 computers infected with the virus. In July, the Bkav Technology Group discovered that more than 560,000 computers in Vietnam have been monitored by malware called BrowserSpy that can track users’ actions and steal their personal information, such as bank account details and email and Facebook passwords. VNCERT estimated last year, Vietnam was hit by 13,382 cyber attacks, including 6,400 malware; 4,377 deface; and 2,605 phishing attacks.

      " 'Hackers continue to rely on phishing campaigns by using e-mail containing ransomware. Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks are conducted fast without being monitored. It is predicted that BEC attacks will continue to increase over the course of the year, and total damage by such attempts could amount to US$12 billion, according to Trend Micro. Statistics in April and May this year showed that Việt Nam was in the top five countries attacked in this way, focusing on the finance and trade sector, said Myla Pilao, director of Trend Micro Labs at a security conference early this week. According to The Việt Nam Information Security Association (VNISA), the growing cyber security threat in Việt Nam requires Vietnamese businesses to take more proactive approaches to cyber security. Most Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium size, and fail to pay much attention to information security. To combat the growing threat, organisations should use security solutions which enable network monitoring, real-time detection and protection, said VNISA. Network security is forecast to be complicated this year and new attacks threaten businesses. Therefore, users need to be proactive and responsible on the internet to protect themselves and the community from cyber attacks, the association recommended'\n",
      " 'Major General Luong Tam Quang, Chief of the Ministry of Public Security’s Office, made the affirmation while answering reporters’ queries about the draft decree guiding the implementation of the law at the Government’s regular press conference in Hanoi on November 3. He further explained that 18 countries worldwide have issued documents and laws asking foreign enterprises to store critical data within national territory. Among those are the US, Canada, Russia, China, Indonesia, Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Quang also cited the European Union (EU)’s personal data protection regulation that officially took effect on May 25, 2018, allowing individuals to control their personal data when joining social forums. Furthermore, the law’s regulations match capacity of businesses, Quang said, taking Google and Facebook as examples, which have respectively established 70 and 80 representative offices in countries across the world, including Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia in Southeast Asia. They also suit the domestic legal system, covering the 2005 Commerce Law and the 2017 Foreign Trade Management Law, he added. He went on to say that such regulations do not go against international commitments, including treaties relating to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Minister-Chairman of the Government Office Mai Tien Dung said the issuance of the law is necessary, noting that apart from food security and social safety and security, cyber security relates to national sovereignty safeguarding, aiming to ensure a good environment for investment attraction. The National Assembly passed the Law on Cyber Security last June, with majority voting yes to the controversial bill. Four hundred and twenty-three deputies voted to approve the bill, accounting for 86.86 percent of those present at the assembly hall, while only 15 voted against it. Twenty-eight deputies abstained. The law will go into effect on January 1, 2019. The law requires all internet-related service providers, regardless of whether they are foreign or domestic companies, to open a representative office and maintain a customer database in servers based in Vietnam in exchange for authorisation to operate legally in the country'\n",
      " 'In addition to direct costs to handle the crisis, repair systems and pay for lawyers, cyber-attacks could also result in reduced confidence among customers, affecting enterprises’ business activities, Dung added. The Vietnam Institute of Directors (VIOD) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) held a seminar titled ‘Cyber resilience for the board of directors’ in Hanoi on August 16. According to attendees at the seminar, cyber threats are intensifying in Asia. Hackers are 80 percent more likely to attack organisations in Asia, while nearly 80 percent of internet users in Asia have not received training on cyber security. Total economic losses are estimated to reach 1.75 trillion USD, accounting for 7 percent of Asia Pacific’s gross domestic products (GDP). Cyber-attacks might lead to data privacy breaches and losses in confidential information, reputation, customer trust, revenue and jobs, said Sharath Martin, regional policy consultant, ACCA ASEAN & ANZ (Australia – New Zealand). Damage caused by computer viruses caused economic losses of 12.3 trillion VND (540 million USD) in Vietnam last year, according to a survey by the security firm BKAV. Digital usage is increasing in Vietnam, said Martin, as the country has the highest number of registered domains in Asia. The mobile penetration rate stands at 144 percent, of which, 50 percent are smartphones. The country’s e-commerce growth was 35 percent annually. Ha Thu Thanh, VIOD’s chairman of the board of directors, said that network security issues should become the top priority for most of business boards. Boards of directors should prioritise cyber security risks as an issue in risk management, not just a technology problem, Thanh said. “Therefore, boards of directors should play a key role in studying cyber security risks associated with their businesses to know that if the prevention and detection of the risks in the businesses were controlled by the businesses’ management systems or not,” Thanh emphasised. Sharath Martin pointed out key insights for boards of directors. Firstly, boards of directors and senior managers should bring cyber security issues into all boardroom topics. The boards should also develop a cyber security strategy, he said. Secondly, the boards should address their cyber defensive frailties. Businesses should have executives responsible for information security. Thirdly, he highlighted the speed of detection and recovery. Lastly, he said that businesses needed to ensure that the investments in information security must keep pace with technology adoption. Within the framework of the seminar, VIOD and ACCA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to increase the two sides’ co-operation in raising awareness and promoting international corporate governance practices to become key factors for the sustainable development of Vietnamese enterprises'\n",
      " 'In an interview with Sputnik news agency, Vladimir Kolotov said cyberspace is the sovereignty domain of any country like territorial sovereignty, airspace sovereignty and territorial waters sovereignty. Moreover, cyberspace is where hostile actions take place that are just as dangerous as in real life and where terrorists exchange information, he said. He warned that many terrorists are better equipped with knowledge about cyber security than some countries in Southeast Asia. While evaluating cyber security in Vietnam, Professor Kolotov said Vietnam was ranked 100th in the global cyber security index. The low cyber security has led to some regrettable cases, he noted, saying that the opposition to the approval of the law lends a hand to the country’s cyber safety, posing risks to not only the cyberspace sovereignty but also the actual sovereignty of the nation. The adoption of the Law on Cyber Security does not violate or interfere with free speech, he said, adding that the law covers different things which are related to the infrastructure of the internet and the management of metadata. Similar laws are being implemented in multiple countries around the world, including Russia, with the purpose of protecting citizens’ interests, he said'\n",
      " 'She made the remark at the Foreign Ministry’s regular press conference on June 14 in response to reporters’ question about the recently adopted Law on Cyber Security. She said the Law on Cyber Security was approved on June 12 with the majority of votes after many rounds of discussions which took into account opinions of National Assembly deputies and the public in a widespread and transparent manner. Cyber security is an important issue that greatly affects national security, Hang said, noting that it has become a special concern of many countries and international and regional organisations in recent years. Attacks on the cyber environment have grown fast in both form and scale and occurred across border, seriously affecting the economic and political stability of each country, she said. Meanwhile, efforts to improve security on the cyber environment still face numerous difficulties, especially due to the shortage of legal regulations and capacity of ensuring cyber security. Therefore, the building of the Law on Cyber Security is critically necessary in the current context, the spokeswoman stressed.

It has 7 chapters and 43 articles, regulating activities to protect national security and ensure social order and safety on cyberspace, and responsibilities of agencies, organisations and individuals concerned'\n",
      " 'Speakers expressed concern that in the latest edition of the International Telecommunication Union’s Global Cyber Security Index, Viet Nam ranks 101st out of 165 nations in terms of being vulnerable to cyber attacks. “Low awareness of cyber security among high-ranking officials, system operating staff and people is the major obstacle to cyber security in Viet Nam,” said Le Manh Ha, vice chairman of the Government Office and secretary general of the National Committee for Information Technology Application. While cyber attacks could occur at any time, few State offices, organisations and enterprises have designated cyber security experts on staff, he revealed. “We must have human resources for cyber security because it has great implications for socio-economic development and even national security,” he said. “Cyber security experts must be hired and paid high wages.” Authorities estimate that around 72 per cent of mobile devices in Viet Nam are infected by viruses. “The figure once again shows low awareness of cyber security among people who use mobile devices,” said Hoang Minh Tien, deputy director of the Ministry of Information and Communications’ Department of Information Security. To improve the situation, Ha suggested that the Government encourage and support the development of cyber security human resources at companies. “We should not wait for protection from authorities. Enterprises should protect themselves first by investing in cyber security human resources.” According to a report from cyber security company Symantec, Viet Nam was among the world’s top 10 countries hardest-hit by cyber crime. It still has a relatively poor record of tracking down the cyber threats it faces: Viet Nam was responsible for 2.16 per cent of global threat detections in 2016, up from 0.89 per cent in 2015. It also suffered the largest number of cyber attacks of any country last year. It ranked second in terms of attacks on Internet of Things devices with 15 per cent of such attacks hitting Vietnamese devices, only behind China’s 17 per cent. “Traditional cyber security problems like ransomware, malware and spam are still common,” said Dr Vo Van Khang, vice chairman of the Viet Nam Information Security Association’s southern office. “But cyber security for Internet of Things devices, industrial control systems and the smart city should get special attention.” He said related authorities should complete the legal framework for information safety and cyber security, invest in and create a mechanism for training and fostering human resources, and make agency heads accountable for cyber security. “Enterprises should invest more in cyber security and work more with cyber security organisations and enterprises to improve their knowledge and acquire experience.” Speaking at the event, Tran Vinh Tuyen, vice chairman of the city People’s Committee, said HCM City would pay more attention to securing information safety and improving cyber security in the context of that the smart city project is going to launch soon. Assoc Prof Dr Duong Anh Duc, director of HCM City’s Department of Information and Communications, said: “HCM City is going to become a smart city where every bit of information will be transparent and easily accessible by local authorities, enterprises, partners and the public. It means more targets for cyber attacks and more information to take advantage of [by criminals]. We consider establishing the cyber security centre - one of the four important elements of the smart city project.” The theme of the conference was “Intelligent Security in Smart Connected World”.'\n",
      " 'The Vietnam Law and Legal Forum, under the Vietnam News Agency, talks with Lieutenant General Hoang Phuoc Thuan, Director of the Cyber Security Department of the Ministry of Public Security, about some controversial issues governed by the draft law. Over the past few years, the cyber security situation has developed complicatedly. Series of cyber-attacks and security incidents have been reported by local media. Could you elaborate on the necessity to make the Law on Cyber Security in Vietnam today? The cyber security situation in the world and Vietnam is undergoing complicated developments. There are tens of thousands of cyber-attacks that target Vietnam’s information system happening every year. Fake news, fabrication, calumniation, aspersion, outrage, and incitation of violence have become rampant in the cyberspace, particularly in social networks. Cyberspace has somehow turned into an “asylum” for crimes and violations. Cybercrime, particularly such organized ones as gambling, organization of gambling, swindling to appropriate property, and trading in fake or banned goods, has developed complicatedly. This situation is attributable to the lack of a legal framework in the field of cyber security. The formulation and promulgation of the Law on Cyber Security aims to meet the urgent requirements arising from the country’s cyber security situation and the need to protect the national security, the State’s secrets, social order, and lawful rights and interests of organizations and individuals. The Law will also help address existing shortcomings and limitations in the state management of cyber and information security and further promote the role of line ministries and functional agencies in assurance of cyber and information security. Additionally, the enactment of the Law can also be regarded as a complete and timely institutionalization of the Party’s policies on cyber security, while ensuring compliance with the 2013 Constitution’s provisions on human rights, fundamental rights of citizens and safeguard of the Fatherland. The Law’s provisions conform to international practice as a matter of fact that many countries in the world have issued their own cyber security laws. It can be said that cyberspace exists in all aspects of social life, including e-commerce. The draft law contains specific provisions requiring user data and important data to be stored in the country. So what subjects will be governed by these provisions and which data will be stored within Vietnam’s territory? As we all know, many countries have set forth requirements for domestic storage of important data, for example, the United States, Canada, Russia, Germany, China, Indonesia, Greek, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Turkey,  Venezuela, Columbia, Argentina, and Brazil. On May 25, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation officially came into force, empowering EU citizens to look up, change or delete their personal information, thus they can control their personal data when joining forums and social networks. The EU also requires service providers to inform service users of how their personal information will be used and commit to not providing such information to third parties. Violating companies may be fined up to EUR 20 million or 40 percent of their worldwide turnover. Looking at these examples, we can see that the draft Law’s provisions are appropriate and progressive. It can be confirmed that the draft Law on Cyber Security neither forces all organizations and individuals to comply with these provisions nor requires storage of all data. Based on the requirements for ensuring and safeguarding national security, social order and fine cultural and ethical values and traditions of Vietnam, the Government will specify which types of organizations and agencies and which kinds of data will be governed by these regulations. There have been opinions that these aforesaid data storage requirements do not conform to Vietnam’s international commitments and will block cross-border data flows and reduce the country’s GDP. What is your opinion? When elaborating these regulations, the Drafting Board carefully reviewed Vietnam’s commitments as well as treaties which the country has acceded to, including the WTO’s commitments and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Hence, I can affirm that the draft Law’s provisions on data storage are not contrary to or violate the country’s commitments. They also do not prevent Vietnam from fulfilling its international commitments. As we know, all bilateral and multilateral commitments have exceptions serving security, public order, culture, and community well-being. This means that interests of member states to international commitments are always upheld and respected for. There is no commitment that forces us to give up these interests. In fact, some member states of the WTO have enacted similar regulations and, therefore, set precedents for Vietnam without violating WTO commitments. As for the opinion that these regulations will block cross-border data flows, I can confirm that nothing is hindered here by this draft Law. Cloud computing technology enables data access from everywhere, regardless of whether such data is stored in Vietnam or the US. The draft Law only requires the storage of some kinds of data in Vietnam but not restrict access to such data. Recently, some persons cited statistics of the European Center for International Political Economy (ECIPE), saying that data localization may reduce Vietnam’s GDP by 1.7 percent and foreign investment by 3.1 percent. However, they seemed to “forget” that such statistics came from a report titled “The costs of data localization: Friendly fire on economic recovery” released by the ECIPE four years ago (March 2014). The report, which was prepared based on the most negative scenarios, also put forth similar forecasts for the EU, China, India, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and Brazil. However, reality has proven the opposite. In 2015, one year after the ECIPE gave its evaluations, Vietnam attained the highest GDP growth rate in the 2010-2015 period and has managed to maintain an impressive growth until now. The EU and other countries mentioned in the report are now managing personal data in a more and more stringent manner. So, we can see that these predictions are wrong and the quotation of such statistics without complete context is intended for unclear purposes. Thus, when there is a scientific and thorough approach to the draft Law’s provisions, one will find that the data storage requirement is conformable with domestic laws and international practice and not contrary to treaties which Vietnam has acceded to and does not obstruct activities of businesses. However, some opine that this requirement is infeasible now when all enterprises use cloud computing and server virtualization/virtual private servers for data storage. What’s your opinion on this issue? As I have said, cloud computing technology permits data to flow regardless of where such data are stored. Therefore, the data storage requirement in the draft Law is technologically feasible and will not create any obstruction. Similar rules have been adopted by many countries. In fact, according to statistics we knew, Google and Facebook have installed or hired nearly 2,000 servers in our territory in order to improve their service quality. This shows that data storage is not only technologically feasible but also helpful to improve connectivity and quality of services. At present, it is assumed that all enterprises doing business in cyberspace related to Vietnam will have to open representative offices in the country, which would cause difficulties to enterprises as they have to bear higher cost and carry out more formalities. What’s your opinion on this matter? We understand that this assumption stems from legitimate concerns of enterprises. We are clearly aware of the importance of foreign enterprises operating in Vietnam. The draft Law itself is aimed at protecting the lawful rights and interests of organizations and individuals, including foreign enterprises. Therefore, the draft Law’s provisions are not intended to cause difficulties to enterprises as well as will not oblige all enterprises to set up their representative offices in Vietnam. However, Vietnamese laws, including the 2005 Commercial Law and the 2017 Foreign Trade Management Law and their implementing regulations, stipulate that all foreign countries’ trade promotion organizations must open representative offices in Vietnam. We all see the fact that enterprises providing cross-border services like Google and Facebook are doing profitable business in Vietnam. As far as I know, Google has set up some 70 representative offices and Facebook 80 representative offices in countries around the world. In the Southeast Asia, Google and Facebook have opened representative offices in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Why they have to do so if not because the establishment of representative offices facilitates their operation. The reality is that our domestic organizations and businesses are subjected to many legal regulations when operating electronic newspapers, websites, social networks, etc. They are also responsible for our security, public order, culture, social morality, fine customs and habits. However, providers of cross-border services into Vietnam are almost free of any constraints and such obligations. Therefore, the registration of legal entities by foreign enterprises in Vietnam will help us create a fair and responsible business environment. However, due to our international commitments, the draft Law does not mandate all enterprises to open representative offices but it will be based on national security and social order and safety requirements, and the Government will issue detailed regulations. By the way, we would like to thank the contributions of the public, business community and international friends who have helped us complete the draft Law through nearly 30 times of revisions. We would like to continue to receive comments and hope that people, organizations and businesses in the country and abroad to endeavor together with the authorities of Vietnam to protect cyber security, contributing to building a safe and healthy cyberspace, contributing significantly to the socio-economic development of every nation and the world.'\n",
      " 'The draft Law on Cyber Security has been revised 14 times, but there are still outstanding controversial issues. Do you have any comments on the latest draft edition of the law? First of all, referring to the adjusted framework of the draft law, much of the contents on safety, security, technology and technique in the 14th draft edition of the law are in line with the Law on Internet Security, which came into force on July 1, 2017. However, there are two major differences concerning the management rules and the State management agencies. These two points will cause difficulties for law enforcement officers and enterprises in implementing the law. In my opinion, quite a few components on the law contradict some existing laws as well as Vietnam’s commitments to a few international laws. For example, the draft law requires foreign suppliers of telecom services or Internet services to establish a representative agency in Vietnam. Such a requirement is not regulated in any WTO documents or the Europe-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). How do you think the component of the draft law that requires foreign suppliers of telecoms and internet services in Vietnam to have operation licences and to establish mechanisms to verify users’ personal information when they create accounts aligns with Vietnam’s commitments with the WTO, EVFTA or the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement? I must say the requirement to open the market on telecoms and Internet services across the border has always been a very important and sensitive issue during negotiations for the Vietnam-US Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) or the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other future free trade agreements. Vietnam has officially committed in the WTO and the EVFTA that all cross-border telecoms and internet services are unlimited, neither the requirement of having their representative offices in Vietnam. In addition, the Chapter on E Commerce in the TPP agreement, which Vietnam signed in February 2016, says “The proposal on server location violated a commitment relating to Location of Computing Facilities (Article 14.13) in the Electronic Commerce Chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)”. Former Vietnamese Minister of Trade Truong Dinh Tuyen, who participated in many negotiations for the TPP and also was a signatory to the Agreement, said, “The topic had been thoroughly discussed before it was written into the TPP treaty.” That’s why Vietnam should honor its commitment. And that totally conforms to our policy to continue to integrate deeper into the international economy in the course of national development. Do you have any concerns that locating the main server abroad will complicate the management of Vietnamese agencies? I should say quite a lot of information on the social network, like Facebook, is biased and incorrect. To minimise the negative impacts of the Internet on our social network over the last 20 years, concerned Vietnamese management agencies and Internet users have used a combination of the technical measures such as firewalls; legal administrative measures; and communication and education campaigns to screen falsified information against the Party, Government and society. The Government has instructed all public agencies and organisations to practice transparency in their activities and launched movements to combat slanderous campaigns against the nation. Do you think that once the Law on Cyber Security is passed by the National Assembly it will have negative impacts on business opportunities for Vietnamese enterprises, as well as the general public’s access to information? The Vietnamese Party and Government have committed to simplifying all administrative procedures and promised to offer favourable conditions for all enterprises to develop so that the people can have better lives. I myself don’t think that when the law is passed by the National Assembly it will have negative impacts on our people’s access to information. However, if the law is approved and it has negative impacts on enterprises’ activities and the people’s access to information, then Vietnam will surely lag behind other countries and its window of opportunity to succeed in industrial revolution 4.0 will become close. The location of the servers is not as important as efforts to ensure cyber security for the data that the servers store.'\n",
      " 'Vietnam ranks 100th in the world and lowest in ASEAN in cyber security. Last year, it suffered 15,000 cyber attacks, which caused losses of half a billion USD. In the first 5 months of this year, agencies reported more than 4,000 hacking incidents. Security risks increase 300% per year, posing severe challenges to Vietnam, which is embarking on the 4th industrial revolution. Law adoption on the right track Vietnam made the right decision when it adopted the Law on Cyber Security at last week’s National Assembly session. Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Le Thi Thu Hang explained, “Cyber security is an essential issue as it affects national security and is a special concern of countries and international organizations. Cross-border cyber attacks are on the rise, seriously impacting the political and economic stability of countries. Efforts to improve cyber security are hampered by a lack of legal institutions and capacity. In this context, the adoption of the Law on Cyber Security was necessary.” Citizens’ legitimate rights protected The law prevents security risks and safeguards national sovereignty and interests and social order. It also protects the legitimate rights of citizens. National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan said at a recent meeting with voters: “The scope of application of the law includes national security, social order and safety, and the legitimate rights of organizations and individuals. Will freedom of information be violated if we give preferences to national security and social safety? These things have been calculated to ensure that personal freedom will not be harmed. The law mainly prevents and fights violations on the internet without hindering normal use of the cyber world. Lawful activities will be protected.” The new law does not restrict freedom of expression. It only lists acts which are defined as illegal by the Penal Code. Vo Van Thuong, Head of the Party Central Committee’s Commission for Communications and Education, briefed voters in Dong Nai on the issue, “The Law on Cyber Security never violates citizens’ freedom of speech. On the contrary, it enables citizens to practice this right in accordance with the law. Everybody can say whatever they want in compliance with the law. The law will help adjust interactions between citizens, between citizens and society, and between citizens and the State.” Compatible with Constitution and international treaties The Law on Cyber Security does not aim to obstruct foreign investment. It strictly regulates online businesses to create a healthier cyber environment. So, the new law is in line with Vietnam’s Constitution and does not hinder the implementation of international treaties Vietnam has signed.'\n",
      " 'According to statistics of the Information Security Department under the Ministry of Information and Communications, 95 per cent of issues related to information security are caused by human negligence. Recently, passwords of more than 1.4 billion e-mail accounts in the world have been disclosed. The Viet Nam Computer Emergency Response Team (VNCERT) analysed and found some 438,000 accounts in Viet Nam, of which some 930 had the government domain name, “gov.vn”. At a year-end meeting on information security-related issues last year, deputy minister of information and communications Nguyen Thanh Hung said the situation of information security would continue to be complicated in 2018. Notably, hackers would use smarter technologies, including artificial intelligence. In addition to this, cyber attacks would become increasingly dangerous and more difficult to detect as hackers were likely to use advanced threats to paralyse national infrastructure, Hung said. He also pointed out one of the main reasons for information insecurity was low levels of awareness. The complexity of information technology depends on the variety of devices being used, with many users in organisations and businesses using personal devices, according to Hung. If they do not have security solutions, the risk to their information will be implicit right in the mobile device itself. Currently, with the development of technology and high speed of transmission lines, the number of internet users in the country has increased rapidly. But users’ perception of information security is low. A majority of Vietnamese people do not have the habit of using software copyrights. VNCERT director Nguyen Trong Duong said malicious software, malicious code and viruses that infiltrated computers were invisible to users. He emphasised on raising awareness of users to detect infected devices, while equipping them with cyber-security knowledge, information technology skills and routines of scanning and upgrading software. Last year, damages caused by computer viruses in Viet Nam were worth VND12.3 trillion (US$547 million), increasing from VND10.4 trillion in 2016. Ngo Tuan Anh, vice president of BKAV technology group, said attacks on Internet of Things equipment or malicious codes of blackmailing or digging out virtual money were increasing both in number and sophistication. Statistics also show that 55 per cent of users use the same passwords for many accounts, which risk password exposure. Technology experts predict that all security network threats this year will stem from attacks on internet-connected devices. Thus, besides raising awareness of users, enterprises and organisations need to apply security policies and technology. Organisations and enterprises as well as individual computer users using the internet should restrict the disclosure of personal information via mobile phones, emails and internet services. Organisations and businesses especially need to protect critical information and implement backup and recovery plans to secure website and email assets'\n",
      " 'Discussion regulations in the law that require user data and important data related to national security to be stored in the country, and all enterprises doing business in cyberspace related to Vietnam to establish headquarters and representative offices in Vietnam, the officer said they are feasible and in line with domestic law and international practices. The regulations neither run counter to treaties to which Vietnam is a party nor obstruct businesses’ operations. According to Duc, 18 countries in the world have set forth requirements for storage of important data within their territories. They are the US, Canada, Russia, France, Germany, China,  Australia, Indonesia, Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Turkey, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Thus, Vietnam is not the first country having this regulation, he noted. Vietnam’s commitments to WTO agreements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), as well as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) also have regulations on security exceptions that allow the respect for and protection of national security at the highest level. Regarding the establishment of representative offices, the police general said several Vietnamese laws, including the 2005 Commercial Law and the 2017 Foreign Trade Management Law and their guiding documents, stipulate that all foreign countries’ trade promotion organisations must open representative offices in Vietnam. Google has set up some 70 representative offices and Facebook 80 representative offices in countries around the world. In Southeast Asia, they have opened representative offices in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. “If these businesses’ operations are hindered and affected by the regulation, it is certain that they will not open that many representatives in countries worldwide,” he stressed, adding that the regulation will also help create a fair business environment, as domestic enterprises are subject to many legal regulations from business registration to operation while foreign firms are not. In addition, the regulation does not require storage of all data related to Vietnam and platform data on cyber space. It only targets certain types of data related to personal secrets in special cases and data related to national security as they are the assets of citizens and the nation that need to be managed and protected, Duc said. Besides, the regulation is not applied to all agencies and organisations operating on Vietnam’s cyber space but only those providing services that can be used to threaten or affect national security. In reality, the lack of management of service users’ data and important national data has been affecting national interests and security, the general stated. At present, hostile forces, reactionary organisations and criminals are increasing the use of cyber space to harm national security, social order and safety while Vietnam’s competent agencies face a lot of difficulties in investigating, verifying, tracing and handling violations because all data are stored overseas. Furthermore, foreign businesses often show little goodwill and cooperation in providing related information, thus hindering the handling of law violations. Users’ data is an asset with unlimited usage value and an input of many economic activities that bring in high profits. While foreign agencies and organisations earn thousands of billions of dong each year from Vietnamese users’ data, the country suffers loss of tax revenue. Therefore, the regulation on data storage and establishment of representative offices will contribute to addressing these problems, he noted. Regarding the concern that personal information will be leaked due to the stipulation that competent agencies must provide users’ information to the cyber security force of the Ministry of Public Security when receiving a written request, Major General Duc affirmed that users’ information will not be revealed. Since their establishment, the specialised force of the Ministry of Public Security has managed data of citizens’ residence, identity and migration and many other fields, but no cases of information leakage have been recorded so far. The absolute guaranteeing of citizens’ personal information is both a responsibility and legal obligation of the force, he said, stressing that if the data is out, they will be strictly punished under the law. About the current cyber security situation in Vietnam, the general cited a report by the Vietnam Computer Emergency Response Team (VNCERT) under the Ministry of Information and Communications which said in 2017, information systems in the country were hit by 15,000 cyber-attacks, including 3,000 Phishing, 6,500 Malware and 4,500 Deface attacks. Last year, losses caused by computer viruses to Vietnamese users amounted to a record high of 12.3 trillion VND (540 million USD). In the first five months of this year, 4,035 cyber-attacks were recorded in Vietnam. With around 637,400 computers controlled by bonnets, Vietnam was ranked fourth among the top 10 worst botnet countries. “Cyber-attacks can only be prevented effectively if there is a detailed and clear legal system to facilitate the implementation of legal measures and international cooperation,” he concluded. The Law on Cyber Security was approved by the National Assembly on June 12 with 86.86 percent of votes. It has seven chapters and 43 articles, regulating activities to protect national security and ensure social order and safety on cyberspace, and responsibilities of agencies, organisations and individuals concerned.'\n",
      " 'The Law on Cyber Security conforms with the Constitution and does not hamper the implementation of international treaties to which Việt Nam is a party, Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokeswoman Lê Thị Thu Hằng said on Thursday. She made the remark at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ press conference in response to reporters’ questions about the recently adopted Law on Cyber Security. She said the law was approved on Tuesday with the majority of votes after many rounds of discussions which took into account the opinions of National Assembly deputies and the public in a widespread and transparent manner. Cyber security is an important issue that greatly affects national security, Hằng said, noting that it has become of special concern for many countries and international and regional organisations in recent years. Attacks on the cyber environment have grown fast in both form and scale and occurred across borders, seriously affecting the economic and political stability of each country, she said. Efforts to improve security on the cyber environment still face numerous difficulties, especially due to the shortage of legal regulations and the capacity of ensuring cyber security. This made the Law on Cyber Security critically necessary in the current context, the spokeswoman stressed. The National Assembly earlier passed the law with an 86.86 percent majority. ‘New momentum’ Responding to a question about the purpose of the draft law on special administrative-economic zones, Hằng said that it was designed to create breakthroughs and add development momentum for the economy by capitalising on advantages in different localities. She said over the past years, the State of Việt Nam has worked to perfect policies and laws and taken many measures to better ensure the legal rights and legitimate interests of the people, while promoting national development and protection and actively integrating into the world. Việt Nam plans to build special administrative-economic zones in northern Quảng Ninh Province, central Khánh Hòa Province and southern Kiên Giang Province. On Monday, the NA agreed to postpone the adoption of the bill until the sixth session of parliament later this year, instead of at the ongoing fifth session. Vietnamese fishermen The Vietnamese embassy in the Republic of Korea is working with local authorities to protect the legitimate rights and interests of two Vietnamese who were allegedly abused while working on a fishing vessel in Seogwipo City, Jeju Island, said spokeswoman Hằng. She said that local police were investigating the case involving Lê Hồng Sơn and Nguyễn Chí Thắng who were working on the fishing vessel 2010 Naekho that operated near Seogwipo. The two are staying at a support centre for foreign workers in Jeju, she added. Vietnamese embassy staff visited the pair last Friday, and confirmed they were in a stable condition.'\n",
      " 'Cyber security regulations should ensure business rights, he cyber security law should be built on a careful assessment of its impacts on businesses and ensure the development of information technology and telecommunications, according to experts at a workshop in Hà Nội on Tuesday. The draft law on cyber security is expected to be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion at the end of this month. Nguyễn Quang Đồng, an expert from the Institute for Policy Studies and Media Development, said the draft law could directly regulate and affect the rights and interests of three enterprise groups, including enterprises that produce and sell cyber security devices and technological solutions, enterprises that provide financial technology services and enterprises that provide digital solutions and services. “We believe that the proposed regulations in the draft would increase operation costs of the mentioned enterprise groups, including compliance costs, licence and administrative procedures costs,” he said. The draft law required enterprises to store data and information within Việt Nam, which had the characteristics of “data localisation”, he said, adding that this could hinder data flows between Việt Nam and other countries, and increase business costs for both domestic and foreign enterprises. The draft law’s regulations on cyber security inspection and assessment require enterprises to suspend or stop selling their products in case such products affect cyber security. The regulation is unclear and may lead to serious risks of violations of legal rights and interests, according to Đồng. This was a critical issue and needed to be considered carefully as strict enforcement of such regulations would have profound impacts on the interests and operation of enterprises, he said. He stressed that the State, enterprises and users were the three key pillars ensuring cyber security. Participants also suggested the drafting committee should clarify the concept of the term “critical information systems to national security”. Concerning cyber security standards applied to enterprises’ information systems and organisations within the private sector, they recommended that solid standards should not be forced on all enterprises. Instead, regulatory bodies should require enterprises to disclose their cyber security standards to users and customers. In terms of approach to the law, they recommended developing the cyber security law in a way that problems can be addressed individually, instead of conducting a general cyber security law. The draft should be narrowed down and adjusted to regulate cyber security of public sector only. Equally, it is necessary to consider a separate law on data protection. At the workshop on cyber security, international experience and recommendations from multi-stakeholders in Việt Nam, participants also discussed the trend of global cyber security, the importance of cross-border data flows in Asia and the development of the digital economy. According to Jon Austin, Principal Solutions Architect of Amazon Web Services, security is not related to the physical location of the data. The internet is global so any system connected to the internet, directly or indirectly, is vulnerable to attacks. “In today’s world, cyber security is really about two things: the security of the physical infrastructure where data is stored and who owns and controls the data,” he said. Lim May-Ann, Executive Director of the Asia Cloud Computing Association, said digital policies were often viewed with a risk-management lens, but regulators needed to move from this stance to one that facilitates economic growth by enabling cross-sectoral compliance and cross-jurisdictional interoperability. She recommended a holistic approach to policy design and regulatory co-ordination and accelerated progress in technical infrastructure'\n",
      " 'The new Cyber Security Law contains stipulations designed to protect citizens from bad and harmful information, requiring both domestic and foreign providers of services on the internet, telecom networks and cyber space in Vietnam to eliminate sources of harmful information by refusing or suspending the supply of service for those sources. At present, data on net users in Vietnam has been used extensively for profit, while there is insufficient legal framework to manage the use. There have even been cases when the data were used for political schemes or law violation. Therefore, the new law stipulates that domestic and foreign providers of services on the cyber space which collect, use, analyse and process users’ personal information and other information created by users in Vietnam, must store such information in Vietnam. Foreign enterprises subject to the stipulation must have a branch or a representative office in Vietnam. Experts agree that the stipulation is in accordance with domestic law, international practice and it neither runs counter to international agreements to which Vietnam is a member nor hinders the operation of enterprises. Major General Nguyen Minh Duc, Director of the Police Science Institute under the People’s Police Academy, noted that there have been 18 countries in the world which require the storage of data inside their territories, including the US, Russia and China. Regarding the stipulation on representative offices, he cited existing regulations that require foreign trade promotion organisations to open representative offices in Vietnam. In addition, the law does not require the storage of all Vietnam-related data and platform data, but only some specific types that are related to personal secrets when necessary, and to national security, because such data are property of citizens and the country, which need to be managed and protected. Furthermore, the stipulation does not apply to all agencies, organisations operating in Vietnam’s cyber space, but only to a number of agencies and organisations providing services that are vulnerable to abuse or that can affect national security. According to Nguyen Thanh Hong, standing member of the National Assembly’s Committee on National Defence and Security, such stipulations are necessary to protect the legitimate rights and interests of individuals, organisations and companies. Hong pointed out that preventative measures are needed to prevent social network service providers from using individuals’ information for illegal purposes, thus violating the legitimate rights and interests of individuals, organisations and businesses. Many people have expressed concern about the possible leakage of personal information as a result of the Cyber Security Law’s stipulation that relevant agencies must supply users’ information to the Public Security Ministry’s cyber security force when there is a written request. However, Major General Duc affirmed that information leakage is impossible. “Ensuring absolute secret of citizens’ personal information is both a responsibility and legal obligation,” he said, noting that any leakage of information will be strictly dealt with in accordance with the law. The Cyber Security Law was adopted by the 14th National Assembly at its 5th session, and will take effect on January 1, 2019'\n",
      " 'The Law on Cyber Security is an important, much needed legal framework for authorised forces to be able to tackle risks and challenges from cyber space in a timely and effective manner, according to the Ministry of Public Security’s Cyber Security Department (CSD). The law, which was adopted during the fifth session of the 14th National Assembly and announced by the President on June 28, is comprised of seven chapters and 43 articles, and will become effective from January 1, 2019. The department reported that Vietnam has faced dozens of serious, large-scale cyber attacks over the past few years, directly threatening national security, social order and safety, and seriously affecting the local economy. The latest statistics from the department show that in the first six months of the year, 2,769 websites and online portals with national domains – 35 of which are managed by Party and State agencies – were either hacked, had their interfaces or content altered, or were deprived of administration authority. What is more, the Internet and some digital services and applications have also been used by hostile forces to spread calls for illegal protests and gatherings that may incite rioting or violate national sovereignty, interests, and security. Meanwhile, the dependence on foreign-origin technology devices has led to an urgent need to form a cyber security industry. CSD Director Hoang Phuoc Thuan said that the Law on Cyber Security clarifies cyber security ensures that activities on the Internet do not harm national security, social order and safety, as well as the legitimate rights and interests of organisations and individuals. This is a new issue, demonstrating the National Assembly’s standpoint on protecting the legitimate rights and interests of organisations and individuals in line with national security, said Thuan. Regarding concerns related to the granting of sub-licences to telecommunications and Internet-based companies, Thuan said that the issues were carefully considered alongside consultations with the business community during the building of the law. “There are no obstacles and there will be none of the sub-licences as rumoured,” stated Thuan. Luu Binh Nhuong, standing member of the National Assembly’s Committee on Social Affairs, said that concerns about limited freedom of speech once the law is adopted are baseless as the issue is not regulated in the Law on Cyber Security, but the Civil Code. The law only controls issues related to cyber security and does not prohibit freedom of speech, said he. “Translating the Law on Cyber Security as prohibiting freedom of speech is a misunderstanding and it should not be referred to in that way,” stressed Nhuong, adding that the law only targets cyber criminals. The law only focuses on preventing and combating high-tech and cyber criminals, and matters related to security, and social order and safety are regulated in other laws, he concluded'\n",
      " 'The Law on Cyber Security, which was recently adopted at the fifth session of the 14th National Assembly, is expected to remedy shortcomings and loopholes in Vietnam’s legal corridors, thus helping to ensure a secure and safe cyberspace. The law does not ban social network users from raising their voices or expressing their standpoints. However, social network users have to abide by the Constitution and legal regulations. The Law on Cyber Security only regulates and tackles information violating regulations as stipulated in the Penal Code and other legal documents. According to the law’s Article 15, information on cyberspace classified as illegal includes anti-state information; information that excites violent disturbance, undermines security and deranges public order; information that causes defamation and slander; information that violates economic management order; and false information that causes public panics, damages socio-economic activities, hampers state agencies’ activities and on-duty persons, and violates rights and benefits of other organisations and individuals. All of such information is likely to harm national security, social order, and illegal rights and benefits of organisations and individuals as stipulated in the Penal Code. Citizens are free to express their political opinions and personal views but they are not allowed to make corrupt use of the rights to distort and oppose the Party and State, excites disturbance, or defame an offend others. The Law on Cyber Security also aims to enhance protection of human rights and citizen rights stipulated in the Constitution. Article 16 presents specific regulations on protecting secrets of businesses, individuals and families. Point a, Clause 2, Article 26 said that domestic and foreign telecommunications service providers have the responsibility to keep personal information and accounts of users secured. Information of Internet users is only accessed by relevant authorities to serve investigation purposes and handle violations of cyber security regulations'\n",
      " 'The Law on Cyber Security is in conformity with the Constitution and does not hamper the implementation of the international treaties to which Vietnam is a party, said Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang.
